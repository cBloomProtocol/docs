# Earning Points Through Missions

Missions are your primary way to earn drops on Bloom Protocol. Learn how to maximize your rewards and build your drops balance efficiently.

## How Mission Rewards Work

### Reward Structure

Each mission offers a specific amount of drops as a reward:
- Reward amounts vary by mission complexity
- Displayed clearly on mission cards and detail pages
- Shown with water drop icon and amount (e.g., "100 Drops")

### Claiming Process

1. **Complete All Tasks**
   - Every task in the mission must be finished
   - No partial rewards for incomplete missions
   - Progress tracked automatically

2. **Claim Your Drops**
   - "Claim Rewards" button activates when ready
   - Click to instantly add drops to your balance
   - No gas fees or waiting period

3. **Instant Credit**
   - Drops appear immediately in navigation menu
   - Balance updates in real-time
   - Transaction completes instantly

## Maximizing Your Earnings

### Strategic Mission Selection

**High-Value Missions**
- Look for missions with larger drop rewards
- Balance reward size with task complexity
- Consider time investment vs. reward

**Quick Completions**
- Start with missions having fewer tasks
- Focus on tasks you can complete immediately
- Build momentum with easy wins

**Aligned Activities**
- Choose missions matching your interests
- Select tasks you'd do anyway
- Combine multiple objectives

### Efficient Task Completion

**Batch Similar Tasks**

- Group platform exploration tasks

**Use Mobile**
- Complete tasks anywhere
- Quick actions during breaks
- Full functionality on all devices

**Plan Your Path**
- Review all tasks before starting
- Ensure you can complete everything
- Avoid starting missions you can't finish

## Understanding Point Values

### Mission Tiers

Missions typically fall into reward tiers:
- **Starter** (50-100 drops) - Simple, few tasks
- **Standard** (100-500 drops) - Moderate complexity
- **Advanced** (500+ drops) - Multiple categories, more tasks

### Task Contribution

- Individual tasks don't give separate rewards
- All tasks contribute to mission completion
- Reward only given when mission is 100% complete

## Tracking Your Earnings

### Dashboard Overview

Monitor your drops in multiple places:
- **Navigation bar** - Current balance always visible
- **Dashboard** - Detailed statistics and history
- **Progress tab** - Activity timeline

### Points History

## Common Questions

No, each mission can only be completed once. New missions are added regularly.

No, partial progress is saved. Return anytime to finish.

### Are there bonus multipliers?
Currently, missions offer fixed rewards. Complete more missions to earn more.
