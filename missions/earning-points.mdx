# Earning Points Through Missions

Missions are your primary way to earn drops on Bloom Protocol. Learn how to maximize your rewards and build your drops balance efficiently.

## How Mission Rewards Work

### Reward Structure

Each mission offers a specific amount of drops as a reward:
- Reward amounts vary by mission complexity
- Displayed clearly on mission cards and detail pages
- Shown with water drop icon and amount (e.g., "100 Drops")

### Understanding Mission Requirements

Each mission has multiple tasks organized by category. To claim drops:

1. **View Mission Tasks**
   - Tasks are grouped by type
   - Each task shows completion status
   - Progress tracked automatically

2. **Complete All Tasks**
   - Work through each task requirement
   - Tasks mark as complete when finished
   - All tasks must be done to claim rewards

3. **Claim Process**
   The reward card shows:
   - Drop amount with water drop icon
   - "Drops" label next to the amount
   - Claim button with different states:
     - **"Complete all tasks"** - Tasks still pending
     - **"Claim Rewards"** - Ready to claim
     - **"Claimed"** - Already claimed
     - **"Processing..."** - Claim in progress

### Reward Display

Rewards are shown with:
- Gradient water drop icon (green gradient)
- Amount in bold text
- "Drops" label in lighter text

### Instant Credit

When you successfully claim:
- Drops appear immediately in navigation menu
- Balance updates in real-time
- Transaction completes instantly
- No gas fees or waiting period

## Maximizing Your Earnings

### Strategic Mission Selection

**High-Value Missions**
- Look for missions with larger drop rewards
- Balance reward size with task complexity
- Consider time investment vs. reward

**Quick Completions**
- Start with missions having fewer tasks
- Focus on tasks you can complete immediately
- Build momentum with easy wins

**Aligned Activities**
- Choose missions matching your interests
- Select tasks you'd do anyway
- Combine multiple objectives

### Efficient Task Completion

**Batch Similar Tasks**
- Complete all social media tasks together
- Handle verifications in one session
- Group platform exploration tasks

**Use Mobile**
- Complete tasks anywhere
- Quick actions during breaks
- Full functionality on all devices

**Plan Your Path**
- Review all tasks before starting
- Ensure you can complete everything
- Avoid starting missions you can't finish

## Understanding Point Values

### Mission Tiers

Missions typically fall into reward tiers:
- **Starter** (50-100 drops) - Simple, few tasks
- **Standard** (100-500 drops) - Moderate complexity
- **Advanced** (500+ drops) - Multiple categories, more tasks

### Task Contribution

- Individual tasks don't give separate rewards
- All tasks contribute to mission completion
- Reward only given when mission is 100% complete

## Tracking Your Earnings

### Dashboard Overview

Monitor your drops in multiple places:
- **Navigation bar** - Current balance always visible
- **Dashboard** - Detailed statistics and history
- **Progress tab** - Activity timeline

### Points History

Your Progress section shows:
- When you earned drops
- Which missions provided rewards
- Cumulative growth over time

## Common Questions

### Can I repeat missions?
No, each mission can only be completed once. New missions are added regularly.

### Do uncompleted tasks expire?
No, partial progress is saved. Return anytime to finish.

### Are there bonus multipliers?
Currently, missions offer fixed rewards. Complete more missions to earn more.

### What if I can't complete a task?
Focus on missions you can fully complete. Partial completion gives no rewards.

## Tips for Success

### Daily Habits
- Check for new missions regularly
- Complete at least one mission when possible
- Track your progress daily

### Long-term Strategy
- Pace yourself to avoid burnout
- Focus on sustainable participation
- Build consistent earning patterns
