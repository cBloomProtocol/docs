## Common Issues

### Submission Not Detected

<Accordion title="My post isn't showing up after 10+ minutes" icon="magnifying-glass">

**Most common causes**:

1. **Missing @bloom_mission mention**
   - Solution: Check your post, add mention if missing, or repost

2. **Protected Twitter account**
   - Solution: Make your account public in X settings

3. **Incorrect mention format**
   - Problem: Using @bloom-mission (dash) instead of @bloom_mission (underscore)
   - Solution: Repost with correct format

4. **Post is a reply, not main tweet**
   - Problem: System may not scan replies
   - Solution: Post as main tweet, not reply to another post

**Action steps**:
```
1. Verify all 3 requirements in your post:
   □ @bloom_mission (with underscore)
   □ Project team mention
   □ Your profile link

2. Check your X account is public

3. Wait full 10 minutes (system scans every 3 min)

4. Use Manual Submission on mission page
```

**Manual Submission**:
- Go to mission detail page
- Find "Manual Submission" card
- Paste your X post URL
- Click Submit
- See instant validation result

</Accordion>

### Validation Errors

<Accordion title="Getting 'Requirements Missing' error" icon="triangle-exclamation">

**Error message meanings**:

| Error | What's Wrong | How to Fix |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **"Missing @bloom_mission mention"** | Can't find @bloom_mission in post | Add mention and post again |
| **"Missing dev team mention"** | Project team account not mentioned | Add @ProjectName and post again |
| **"Invalid profile link"** | Link doesn't work or doesn't exist | Check link format, verify it's public |
| **"Profile link not found"** | UID doesn't exist in system | Verify you're logged in, profile is active |
| **"Twitter account not public"** | System can't read your post | Change X settings to public |

**How to fix and resubmit**:
1. Read the specific error message
2. Fix the issue in a NEW post
3. Post the corrected version
4. System will replace old submission automatically

**Example fix**:
```
❌ First post (error):
"Just tested @ProjectX! bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
→ Error: Missing @bloom_mission

✓ Fixed post:
"Just tested @ProjectX! Detailed feedback below.
bloomprotocol.ai/alice @ProjectX @bloom_mission"
→ Success: All requirements met
```

</Accordion>

### Pending Review Status

<Accordion title="Stuck in 'Pending Review' for days" icon="clock">

**Normal timeline**: 24-48 hours for most missions

**Why it might take longer**:
- High volume of submissions (popular missions)
- Project team timezone differences
- Weekends/holidays
- Additional verification needed
- Complex missions requiring thorough review

**When to be concerned**: After 72 hours (3 days)

**What to do**:

1. **Verify mission is still active**
   - Check deadline hasn't passed
   - Confirm mission wasn't cancelled

2. **Review your submission quality**
   - Does it meet all requirements?
   - Is content quality sufficient?
   - Did you provide evidence/proof?

3. **Check for project updates**
   - Look at mission page for announcements
   - Check project's X account for updates
   - See if other submissions are being approved

4. **Contact support after 3+ days**
   - Include your X post URL
   - Include mission name/ID
   - Describe what you submitted
   - Attach screenshots

**Pro tip**: Quality submissions get reviewed faster. If yours is thorough, has evidence, and clearly meets requirements, it's likely just in queue.

</Accordion>

### Payment Issues

<Accordion title="Approved but haven't received rewards" icon="coins">

**Check these first**:

1. **Drops (Bloom points)**
   - Check your dashboard balance
   - Look at navigation bar (top right)
   - Verify in profile transaction history
   - Should be instant upon approval

2. **Partner tokens (USDT, etc.)**
   - Check your wallet (not Bloom platform)
   - Wait 24 hours (blockchain transactions take time)
   - Verify correct wallet is connected
   - Check blockchain explorer for transaction

**Troubleshooting steps**:

```
Step 1: Verify approval
□ Mission page shows "Approved" status
□ Submission appears in approved list
□ Confirmation received

Step 2: Check correct location
□ Drops → Bloom dashboard
□ Tokens → Your crypto wallet

Step 3: Verify connection
□ Profile link is public
□ Wallet is connected to profile
□ Correct wallet address

Step 4: Check transaction
□ Look up on blockchain explorer
□ Search by your wallet address
□ Check recent transactions

Step 5: Contact support (after 48 hours)
□ Provide submission URL
□ Provide wallet address
□ Provide screenshot of approval
```

**Most common issue**: Wallet not properly connected to X402 profile link. Go to profile settings and verify wallet connection.

</Accordion>

### Rejection Reasons

<Accordion title="Why was my submission rejected?" icon="ban">

**Common rejection reasons**:

| Reason | What Happened | How to Avoid |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **AI-generated content** | Detected ChatGPT/Claude patterns | Write yourself, show authentic voice |
| **Generic feedback** | Too vague, no specifics | Include details, screenshots, examples |
| **Didn't complete task** | No evidence of actual work | Actually test/use the product |
| **Copied content** | Plagiarized from others | Create original content |
| **Spam-like** | Low effort, template responses | Put in genuine effort |
| **Requirements not met** | Missing mission-specific criteria | Read requirements carefully |
| **Poor quality** | Unprofessional, errors, unclear | Proofread, format properly |

**What to do after rejection**:

1. **Learn from it**: Read the rejection reason carefully
2. **Don't repeat mistakes**: Understand what was insufficient
3. **Try other missions**: Don't let one rejection discourage you
4. **Improve quality**: Next submission should address the issues

**Can you resubmit?**: Usually no, unless mission allows multiple attempts. Check mission rules.

**Appeal process**: If you believe rejection was unfair, contact support with evidence.

</Accordion>

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About Submissions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I delete my submission?" icon="trash">

**Short answer**: No direct delete, but you can replace it.

**How replacement works**:
- Post a new submission with same requirements
- System automatically replaces old submission
- Old post archived in system
- Only latest submission counts

**If you want to withdraw entirely**:
- Contact support with your submission details
- Explain why you want to withdraw
- Support team can remove it manually

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I submit the same content to multiple missions?" icon="copy">

**Not recommended**, and often against rules.

**Why it's problematic**:
- Each project wants unique, tailored feedback
- Generic content usually gets rejected
- Projects can see your other submissions
- Damages your reputation

**Better approach**:
- Customize content for each project
- Address their specific requirements
- Show you understand their unique product
- Build quality over quantity

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use a different Twitter account for different missions?" icon="users">

**Yes, as long as you use consistent UID (profile link).**

**Rules**:
- ✓ Different missions = Can use different accounts
- ✗ Same mission = Cannot switch accounts
- ✓ One account per mission (your choice which)
- ✓ Same UID across all submissions

**Why this matters**: Anti-fraud system tracks UID consistency, not Twitter account consistency across missions.

**Best practice**: Use one Twitter account for all social missions for simplicity.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I made a typo in my profile link?" icon="spell-check">

**If you haven't posted yet**: Fix it before posting.

**If you already posted with wrong link**:
1. Post again with correct link
2. System will replace old submission
3. Verify new link is correct this time

**How to avoid**:
- Save your correct link in notes
- Copy-paste, don't type manually
- Test link in browser before using
- Set up keyboard shortcut or text replacement

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to follow the project on X?" icon="user-plus">

**Not required by system, but highly recommended.**

**Why you should**:
- Shows genuine interest
- Projects may check follower status
- You'll see important mission updates
- Community engagement looks better
- Some missions may require it explicitly

**Check mission requirements**: Some missions do explicitly require following.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### About Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How long do rewards take?" icon="stopwatch">

**Typical timeline**:

| Reward Type | Normal | Fast | Slow |
|------------|--------|------|------|
| **Bloom Drops** | Instant | Instant | Instant |
| **USDT/USDC** | 10-30 min | 5 min | 2 hours |
| **Project Tokens** | 30min-2h | 10 min | 24 hours |

**Factors affecting speed**:
- Blockchain network congestion

- Project's payment processing
- Time of day (gas prices vary)

**When to worry**: After 48 hours, contact support.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I choose which wallet receives tokens?" icon="wallet">

**Yes, through your profile settings.**

**How to set/change**:
1. Go to Profile → Settings
2. Find "X402 Link" or "Payment Settings"
3. Connect your preferred wallet
4. Verify connection successful
5. Test with small mission first

**Important notes**:
- Changes apply to future payments
- Existing submissions use old wallet
- Verify wallet supports token's blockchain
- Keep wallet secure and accessible

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there minimum payout amounts?" icon="dollar-sign">

**For Bloom Drops**: No minimum. Every drop counts.

**For partner tokens**: Depends on the mission.
- Most missions pay immediately regardless of amount
- Some projects may have minimum thresholds
- Check mission details for specific requirements

**Gas fee consideration**: For very small token amounts, project may batch payments to save on gas fees.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I lost access to my wallet?" icon="key">

**Before you receive payment**:
1. Update wallet in profile settings immediately
2. Verify new wallet is connected
3. Contact mission team if urgent

**After payment sent but not received**:
- If you have seed phrase: Recover wallet
- If you lost everything: Contact support immediately
- They may be able to help depending on timing

**Prevention**:
- Backup seed phrase securely
- Use hardware wallet for large amounts
- Keep wallet software updated
- Don't lose device without backup

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I convert drops to real money?" icon="money-bill-transfer">

**Currently**: Drops are Bloom Protocol platform points, not cryptocurrency.

**What you can do**:
- Track contributions
- Build reputation
- Access platform benefits
- Future utility (TBA)

**For real money**: Focus on missions offering USDT, USDC, or other crypto tokens.

**Future**: Check Bloom Protocol announcements for drops utility updates.

</Accordion>
