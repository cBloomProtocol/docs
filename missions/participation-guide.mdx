Participating in social missions is simple: post on X with the right elements, and Bloom Protocol handles the rest.

## The Three Must-Haves

Every social mission submission requires three essential elements. Miss any one, and your submission won't be detected or approved.

### 1. Mission Account Mention

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="@bloom_mission">

**What**: Include @bloom_mission in your post

**Why**: This is how our system discovers your submission when scanning X

**Format**: Type it exactly as `@bloom_mission` (lowercase, with underscore)

**Example Post**:
```
Just completed the awesome challenge from @ProjectTeam!
Here's my detailed feedback 👇
@bloom_mission
```

<Warning>
**Common mistakes**:
- Writing `@bloom-mission` (dash instead of underscore)
- Writing `@bloomprotocol` (different account)
- Forgetting to include it entirely
</Warning>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Project Team Mention

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Dev Team Account">

**What**: Mention the project's X account specified in the mission details

**Why**: Connects your submission to the specific mission and notifies the project team

**Where to find it**: Look for "Dev Team" or "Project Account" in the mission details page

**Example from mission page**:
```
Mission by: Seedify (@SeedifyFund)
You must mention: @SeedifyFund
```

**Example Post**:
```
Tested @SeedifyFund's new launchpad feature.
The UX is incredibly smooth! Full review: [link]

```

<Note>
Different missions have different project accounts. Always check the mission details for the correct account to mention.
</Note>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Public Profile Link

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Your Bloom Public Profile Page link">

**What**: Your unique Bloom Protocol profile link (format: `bloomprotocol.ai/your-uid`)

**Why**: This is how you receive instant payments. It's your X402 payment address.

**Where to find yours**:
1. Go to Bloom Protocol platform
2. Navigate to Profile → Settings
3. Look for "X402 Link" or "Public Profile Link" section
4. Copy your unique link

**Example link**: `bloomprotocol.ai/47981824`

**In your post**:
```
My comprehensive analysis of @ProjectName's
ecosystem 🧵👇

bloomprotocol.ai/47981824
@ProjectName @bloom_mission
```

<Warning>
**Critical**: Your profile link must be public and active. Test it by:
1. Opening the link in an incognito browser
2. Verifying your profile loads
3. Confirming it shows your public information
</Warning>

**Setting up your link**: See [Rewards & X402 guide](/missions/rewards-and-x402#setting-up-your-x402-link) for detailed setup instructions.

## Good Submission Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Testing Feedback">

```
✓ GOOD EXAMPLE:

"Just spent 30min testing @ProjectX's new dashboard.

What worked well:
• Onboarding flow is smooth (3 steps, took 2min)
• Dark mode is 🔥
• Transaction history loads fast

What could improve:
• Export button is hard to find
• Mobile view cuts off some text
• Would love batch actions

Overall: Solid update! 8/10

@bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
```

**Why it works**: Specific details, balanced feedback, evidence of actual usage

</Tab>
<Tab title="Content Creation">

```
✓ GOOD EXAMPLE:

"🧵 Why @ProjectY's approach to DeFi is different

1/ Traditional platforms make you jump through hoops...

2/ ProjectY simplifies this with [specific feature]...

3/ I tested it myself. Here's what happened... [screenshot]

[...detailed thread with real experience...]

10/ My take: If you're tired of complex DeFi, try this.

@bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
```

**Why it works**: Original analysis, personal testing, detailed thread with value

</Tab>
<Tab title="Bug Report">

```
✓ GOOD EXAMPLE:

"Found a bug in @ProjectZ's staking interface

Steps to reproduce:
1. Connect wallet (MetaMask, Chrome)
2. Try to stake 100 tokens
3. Transaction fails with error: [screenshot]

Expected: Stake transaction succeeds
Actual: Error message, tokens not staked

Browser: Chrome 120
Device: Desktop

@bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
```

**Why it works**: Detailed bug report, reproducible steps, includes environment info

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Can I Submit Multiple Times?

**Yes! You can improve your submission by end of time.**

This is one of the best features of social missions - you're not locked into your first attempt.

### How Replacement Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Post #1: First Attempt">
    You submit your initial post. System creates submission #1.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Realize You Can Do Better">
    Maybe you found more insights, created better content, or got more thorough feedback.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post #2: Improved Version">
    You post again with all required elements. System detects it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic Replacement">
    System sees it's the same user (UID), same Twitter account, different post.
    Submission #1 is replaced by submission #2.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Old Post Archived">
    Your first post is marked as "replaced by [new post]" in the system (audit trail).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Replacement Rules

| Condition | Required? | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Same UID | ✓ Yes | Must be your profile link |
| Same Twitter account | ✓ Yes | Can't switch accounts |
| Different post | ✓ Yes | Must be a new post |
| Same mission | ✓ Yes | Replaces within that mission only |
| Before deadline | ✓ Yes | Can't replace after mission ends |

<Check>**You can**: Submit as many improved versions as you want before deadline</Check>
<Check>**You can**: Replace even after initial approval (if deadline hasn't passed)</Check>
<Check>**System automatically**: Keeps only your latest submission</Check>

<Warning>
**You cannot**:
- Submit from multiple Twitter accounts for the same mission
- Use different profile links (UIDs) for the same mission
- Replace after the mission deadline has passed
- Submit the same exact post URL multiple times
</Warning>

### Why This Matters

> **Quality is encouraged, not punished**
>
> The replacement feature means:
> - No penalty for experimenting
> - Iterate based on what you learn
> - Submit when you're proud of it, not when you're rushed
> - Your best work counts, not your first work

### Replacement Example

```
Monday 10:00 AM - First attempt
"Tested @ProjectX. It's good! @bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
→ Created submission #1

Monday 3:00 PM - You realize you can do better
"After deeper testing of @ProjectX, here's my detailed analysis:

 [5-tweet thread with specific feedback, screenshots, insights]

 @bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
→ Submission #1 replaced by submission #2

Result: Only your detailed thread is evaluated. First post is archived.
```

**Participation philosophy**: Quality submissions come from genuine engagement. Take time to actually use what you're reviewing. Provide honest, specific feedback. Include evidence of your work. Projects can tell the difference between rushed submissions and thoughtful contributions - and so can your rewards.
