Participating in social missions is simple: post on X with the **2+1** elements, and Bloom Protocol handles the rest.

**The 2+1 elements:**
<Check>@bloom_mission</Check>
<Check>Project team account mention</Check>
<Note>Your public profile link (if Twitter not connected)</Note>


## Good Submission Example

A good submission must include the two required elements: the mission account mention (@bloom_mission) 
and the project team account mention. If you haven't connected your X ( previously Twitter ) account yet, 
also include your public profile page link. <br /><br />
Here's what a complete submission looks like:

```
"Just spent 30min testing @ProjectX's new dashboard.

What worked well:
• Onboarding flow is smooth (3 steps, took 2min)
• Dark mode is 🔥
• Transaction history loads fast

What could improve:
• Export button is hard to find
• Mobile view cuts off some text
• Would love batch actions

Overall: Solid update! 8/10

**Just to remind you ☺️**
<Tip>If you had connect X account when configuring you public page, you don't need to include the link in the post</Tip>
<Tip>If you had connect X account when configuring you public page, you don't need to include the link in the post</Tip>
<Tip>If you had connect X account when configuring you public page, you don't need to include the link in the post</Tip>

## What if my post ( submission ) is a thread 😳 ?
<Note>
All 2+1 elements must be in the first post of your thread.
</Note>

You **must include the 2+1 elements in the first post.**


**Example of correct thread structure:**
```
Post 1 (First post):
"🧵 My detailed analysis of @ProjectX's new feature

[Your opening content...]

Post 2, 3, 4... (Continuation):

```

## The Two Must-Haves

Every social mission submission requires two essential elements. Miss any one, and your submission won't be detected or approved.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="@bloom_mission">

**What**: Include @bloom_mission in your post

**Why**: This is how our system discovers your submission when scanning X

**Format**: Type it exactly as `@bloom_mission` (lowercase, with underscore)

**Example Post**:
```
Just completed the awesome challenge from @ProjectTeam!
Here's my detailed feedback 👇
@bloom_mission
```

<Warning>
**Common mistakes**:
- Writing `@bloom-mission` (dash instead of underscore)
- Writing `@bloomprotocol` (different account)
- Forgetting to include it entirely
</Warning>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Dev Team Account">

**What**: Mention the project's X account specified in the mission details

**Why**: Connects your submission to the specific mission and notifies the project team

**Where to find it**: Look for "Dev Team" or "Project Account" in the mission details page

**Example from mission page**:
```
Mission by: Seedify (@SeedifyFund)
You must mention: @SeedifyFund
```

**Example Post**:
```
Tested @SeedifyFund's new launchpad feature.
The UX is incredibly smooth! Full review: [link]

```

<Note>
Different missions have different project accounts. Always check the mission details for the correct account to mention.
</Note>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connect Twitter or Include Your Link

<Tip>
If you haven't connected your Twitter account in settings, you must include your public profile link in your post.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Your Bloom Public Profile Page link">

**What**: Your unique Bloom Protocol profile link (format: `bloomprotocol.ai/your-uid`)

**Why**: This is how you receive instant payments. It's your X402 payment address.

**When you need it**: Only if you haven't connected your Twitter account in Profile → Settings. If your Twitter is already connected, our system automatically links your submission to your account, and you can skip this.

**Where to find yours**:
1. Go to Bloom Protocol platform
2. Navigate to Profile → Settings
3. Look for "X402 Link" or "Public Profile Link" section
4. Copy your unique link

**Example link**: `bloomprotocol.ai/47981824`

**In your post**:
```
My comprehensive analysis of @ProjectName's
ecosystem 🧵👇

bloomprotocol.ai/47981824
@ProjectName @bloom_mission
```

<Warning>
**Critical**: Your profile link must be public and active. Test it by:
1. Opening the link in an incognito browser
2. Verifying your profile loads
3. Confirming it shows your public information
</Warning>

**Setting up your link**: See [Rewards & X402 guide](/missions/rewards-and-x402#setting-up-your-x402-link) for detailed setup instructions.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Can I Submit Multiple Times?

**Yes! You can improve your submission by end of time.**

This is one of the best features of social missions - you're not locked into your first attempt.

<Check>**You can**: Submit as many improved versions as you want before deadline</Check>
<Check>**You can**: Replace even after initial approval (if deadline hasn't passed)</Check>
<Check>**System automatically**: Keeps only your latest submission</Check>

<Warning>
**You cannot**:
- Submit from multiple Twitter accounts for the same mission
- Use different profile links (UIDs) for the same mission
- Replace after the mission deadline has passed
- Submit the same exact post URL multiple times
</Warning>

**Participation philosophy**: Quality submissions come from genuine engagement. Take time to actually use what you're reviewing. Provide honest, specific feedback. Include evidence of your work. Projects can tell the difference between rushed submissions and thoughtful contributions - and so can your rewards.
