Participating in social missions is simple: post on X with the right elements, and the system handles the rest. This guide covers everything you need to know about requirements, submission methods, and quality standards.

## The Three Must-Haves

Every social mission submission requires three essential elements. Miss any one, and your submission won't be detected or approved.

### 1. Mission Account Mention

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="@bloom_mission" icon="at">

**What**: Include @bloom_mission in your post

**Why**: This is how our system discovers your submission when scanning X

**Format**: Type it exactly as `@bloom_mission` (lowercase, with underscore)

**Example Post**:
```
Just completed the awesome challenge from @ProjectTeam!
Here's my detailed feedback 👇
@bloom_mission
```

<Warning>
**Common mistakes**:
- Writing `@bloom-mission` (dash instead of underscore)
- Writing `@bloomprotocol` (different account)
- Forgetting to include it entirely
</Warning>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Project Team Mention

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Dev Team Account" icon="users">

**What**: Mention the project's X account specified in the mission details

**Why**: Connects your submission to the specific mission and notifies the project team

**Where to find it**: Look for "Dev Team" or "Project Account" in the mission details page

**Example from mission page**:
```
Mission by: Seedify (@SeedifyFund)
You must mention: @SeedifyFund
```

**Example Post**:
```
Tested @SeedifyFund's new launchpad feature.
The UX is incredibly smooth! Full review: [link]
@bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice
```

<Note>
Different missions have different project accounts. Always check the mission details for the correct account to mention.
</Note>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Public Profile Link

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Your X402 Payment Link" icon="link">

**What**: Your unique Bloom Protocol profile link (format: `bloomprotocol.ai/your-uid`)

**Why**: This is how you receive instant payments. It's your X402 payment address.

**Where to find yours**:
1. Go to Bloom Protocol platform
2. Navigate to Profile → Settings
3. Look for "X402 Link" or "Public Profile Link" section
4. Copy your unique link

**Example link**: `bloomprotocol.ai/47981824`

**In your post**:
```
My comprehensive analysis of @ProjectName's
ecosystem 🧵👇

bloomprotocol.ai/47981824
@ProjectName @bloom_mission
```

<Warning>
**Critical**: Your profile link must be public and active. Test it by:
1. Opening the link in an incognito browser
2. Verifying your profile loads
3. Confirming it shows your public information
</Warning>

**Setting up your link**: See [Rewards & X402 guide](/missions/rewards-and-x402#setting-up-your-x402-link) for detailed setup instructions.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Content Quality Standards

### What Gets Approved

Your submission content is evaluated on authenticity and relevance:

| Quality Factor | What Reviewers Check | Example |
|----------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Originality** | Is this your own work? | Written in your voice, not copied |
| **Authenticity** | Did you actually do the task? | Specific details, screenshots, evidence |
| **Relevance** | Does it address the mission? | On-topic, follows requirements |
| **Effort** | Is it thoughtful? | More than generic praise or complaints |
| **Value** | Does it help the project? | Constructive feedback, real insights |

### The AI Content Rule

<Warning>
**Zero tolerance for AI-generated content**

Projects and reviewers can detect:
- ChatGPT/Claude writing patterns
- Generic AI responses
- Copy-pasted AI content
- Over-polished, unnatural language

**Result**: Instant rejection, possible account flagging

**Why**: Projects want genuine human feedback from real users who tested their product. AI content provides zero value.
</Warning>

### Good Submission Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Testing Feedback">

```
✓ GOOD EXAMPLE:

"Just spent 30min testing @ProjectX's new dashboard.

What worked well:
• Onboarding flow is smooth (3 steps, took 2min)
• Dark mode is 🔥
• Transaction history loads fast

What could improve:
• Export button is hard to find
• Mobile view cuts off some text
• Would love batch actions

Overall: Solid update! 8/10

@bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
```

**Why it works**: Specific details, balanced feedback, evidence of actual usage

</Tab>
<Tab title="Content Creation">

```
✓ GOOD EXAMPLE:

"🧵 Why @ProjectY's approach to DeFi is different

1/ Traditional platforms make you jump through hoops...

2/ ProjectY simplifies this with [specific feature]...

3/ I tested it myself. Here's what happened... [screenshot]

[...detailed thread with real experience...]

10/ My take: If you're tired of complex DeFi, try this.

@bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
```

**Why it works**: Original analysis, personal testing, detailed thread with value

</Tab>
<Tab title="Bug Report">

```
✓ GOOD EXAMPLE:

"Found a bug in @ProjectZ's staking interface

Steps to reproduce:
1. Connect wallet (MetaMask, Chrome)
2. Try to stake 100 tokens
3. Transaction fails with error: [screenshot]

Expected: Stake transaction succeeds
Actual: Error message, tokens not staked

Browser: Chrome 120
Device: Desktop

@bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
```

**Why it works**: Detailed bug report, reproducible steps, includes environment info

## Submission Methods

### Automatic Detection (Recommended)

**How it works**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You post on X">
    Include all three required elements (@bloom_mission, project team, your link)
  </Step>

  <Step title="System scans every 3 minutes">
    Automated service searches X for @bloom_mission mentions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Your post is discovered">
    System validates requirements and creates submission
  </Step>

  <Step title="Status updates automatically">
    Check mission page to see your submission appear
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Timeline**: Usually 3-10 minutes from posting

**Best for**: When you've followed all requirements exactly

**Verification**: Your post will appear in the mission's "Submissions" section

### Manual Submission (Backup)

**When to use**:
- Your post wasn't detected after 10+ minutes
- You want to ensure submission is captured
- You posted before discovering the mission

**How it works**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Post on X first">
    Must post publicly with all requirements before manual submission
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to mission page">
    Navigate to the specific social mission detail page
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Manual Submission card">
    Look for "Manual Submission - Post Taking Longer to Appear?" section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste your post URL">
    Copy your X post URL (format: https://x.com/username/status/1234567890)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Submit">
    System fetches your post and validates requirements
  </Step>

  <Step title="See instant feedback">
    Status message appears below the form
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Interface**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Manual Submission                           │
│ Post Taking Longer to Appear?               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Your post link                    [Submit] │
│                                             │
│ https://x.com/username/status/...           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Status messages you might see**:
- ✅ "Submitted - Status will update once processed"
- ⚠️ "Missing required mentions" (fix and post again)
- ℹ️ "This post is already in queue"

## Submission Status Tracking

## Can I Submit Multiple Times?

### The Replacement Feature

**Yes! You can improve your submission before the deadline.**

This is one of the best features of social missions - you're not locked into your first attempt.

### How Replacement Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Post #1: First Attempt">
    You submit your initial post. System creates submission #1.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Realize You Can Do Better">
    Maybe you found more insights, created better content, or got more thorough feedback.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post #2: Improved Version">
    You post again with all required elements. System detects it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic Replacement">
    System sees it's the same user (UID), same Twitter account, different post.
    Submission #1 is replaced by submission #2.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Old Post Archived">
    Your first post is marked as "replaced by [new post]" in the system (audit trail).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Replacement Rules

| Condition | Required? | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Same UID | ✓ Yes | Must be your profile link |
| Same Twitter account | ✓ Yes | Can't switch accounts |
| Different post | ✓ Yes | Must be a new post |
| Same mission | ✓ Yes | Replaces within that mission only |
| Before deadline | ✓ Yes | Can't replace after mission ends |

<Check>**You can**: Submit as many improved versions as you want before deadline</Check>
<Check>**You can**: Replace even after initial approval (if deadline hasn't passed)</Check>
<Check>**System automatically**: Keeps only your latest submission</Check>

<Warning>
**You cannot**:
- Submit from multiple Twitter accounts for the same mission
- Use different profile links (UIDs) for the same mission
- Replace after the mission deadline has passed
- Submit the same exact post URL multiple times
</Warning>

### Why This Matters

> **Quality is encouraged, not punished**
>
> The replacement feature means:
> - No penalty for experimenting
> - Iterate based on what you learn
> - Submit when you're proud of it, not when you're rushed
> - Your best work counts, not your first work

### Replacement Example

```
Monday 10:00 AM - First attempt
"Tested @ProjectX. It's good! @bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
→ Created submission #1

Monday 3:00 PM - You realize you can do better
"After deeper testing of @ProjectX, here's my detailed analysis:

 [5-tweet thread with specific feedback, screenshots, insights]

 @bloom_mission bloomprotocol.ai/alice"
→ Submission #1 replaced by submission #2

Result: Only your detailed thread is evaluated. First post is archived.
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Top Submission Failures

| Mistake | Why It Fails | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Protected Twitter account** | System can't read posts | Make account public |
| **Wrong mention format** | @bloom-mission vs @bloom_mission | Use underscore, not dash |
| **Missing project mention** | Can't match to mission | Check mission page for correct account |
| **No profile link** | Can't send payment | Include bloomprotocol.ai/your-uid |
| **AI-generated content** | Detected as inauthentic | Write yourself, show real usage |
| **Generic content** | No value to project | Be specific, show real testing |
| **Copy-pasted requirements** | Not original work | Create unique content |

### Red Flags Reviewers Look For

<Warning>
**Instant rejection signs**:
- Copy-pasted text from other submissions
- AI writing patterns (too polished, generic)

- Spam-like content or bot behavior
- Violates mission-specific rules
