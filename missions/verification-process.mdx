# Verification Process

Bloom Protocol uses a robust verification system to ensure fair and accurate task completion. Here's how the process works:

## Verification Types

### Automated Verification
- **Real-Time Checking**: Instant verification for most engagement tasks
- **API Integration**: Direct connection with social platforms
- **Speed**: Typically completes within 1-5 minutes
- **Tasks Covered**: Following, liking, sharing, basic engagement

### Manual Review
- **Content Quality**: Human reviewers assess creative submissions
- **Timeline**: 1-24 hours for review completion
- **Tasks Covered**: Written content, creative posts, bounty submissions
- **Quality Standards**: Originality, relevance, and community value

## Task Status Flow

### Initial State
- **Status**: Pending
- **Button**: Purple "Start" button
- **Action**: Task ready to begin

### Submission State
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Button**: Gray "Processing" button
- **Action**: Verification underway

### Completion States
- **Completed**: Green "Completed" button with checkmark
- **Failed**: Red "Retry" button for resubmission

## Automated Verification Details

### Social Media Engagement
1. **Task Submission**: User clicks task button and completes action
2. **Platform Check**: System queries social platform APIs
3. **Verification**: Confirms completion (follow, like, share)
4. **Status Update**: Immediate green checkmark upon confirmation
5. **Reward Distribution**: Drops automatically added to account

### Supported Platforms
- **Twitter/X**: Follows, likes, retweets, replies
- **Discord**: Server joins, message reactions
- **Telegram**: Channel joins, post interactions
- **YouTube**: Subscriptions, likes, comments

### Verification Timing
- **Immediate**: Simple engagement tasks (follows, likes)
- **1-2 Minutes**: Platform API synchronization delay
- **Up to 5 Minutes**: Network delays or platform rate limits

## Manual Review Process

### Content Submission Tasks
1. **User Submission**: Content uploaded with URL and description
2. **Queue Assignment**: Submission enters moderation queue
3. **Reviewer Assignment**: Available moderator claims the task
4. **Quality Assessment**: Content evaluated against standards
5. **Decision**: Approval or rejection with feedback
6. **Notification**: User receives status update

### Review Criteria

#### Content Quality Standards
- **Originality**: Must be user-created, not copied content
- **Relevance**: Should relate to Bloom Protocol or assigned topic
- **Effort**: Demonstrates thoughtful engagement and effort
- **Community Value**: Contributes positively to the ecosystem

#### Technical Requirements
- **URL Validity**: Links must lead to accessible content
- **Privacy Settings**: Content must be publicly viewable
- **Platform Compliance**: Adheres to social platform rules
- **Character Limits**: Stays within specified length requirements

## Verification Challenges

### Common Rejection Reasons
- **Broken Links**: URLs that don't work or lead to wrong content
- **Private Content**: Posts not publicly accessible
- **Low Quality**: Minimal effort or copy-paste content
- **Off-Topic**: Content unrelated to the task requirements
- **Duplicate Submissions**: Reusing content from previous tasks

### Privacy and Access Issues
- **Profile Privacy**: Ensure social profiles are public
- **Content Visibility**: Check that posts aren't restricted
- **Platform Changes**: Account for platform algorithm updates
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Some content may not be globally accessible

## Resubmission Process

### Failed Task Recovery
1. **Review Feedback**: Check rejection reason in task interface
2. **Content Improvement**: Address specific issues mentioned
3. **Resubmission**: Use "Retry" button to submit again
4. **Fresh Review**: New submission gets independent evaluation

### Best Practices for Resubmission
- **Read Feedback Carefully**: Understand why the submission was rejected
- **Make Substantial Changes**: Don't just resubmit the same content
- **Follow Guidelines**: Review task requirements before resubmitting
- **Quality Focus**: Prioritize quality over speed in resubmissions

## Verification Security

### Anti-Fraud Measures
- **Duplicate Detection**: System identifies repeated submissions
- **Account Verification**: User authentication prevents gaming
- **Pattern Recognition**: Unusual activity patterns trigger additional review
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Multiple verification points for complex tasks

### Fair Play Enforcement
- **Terms Compliance**: All submissions must follow platform terms
- **Community Standards**: Content must meet community guidelines
- **Original Work**: Plagiarism or copied content results in rejection
- **Authentic Engagement**: Genuine interaction required, not automated

## Technical Verification Details

### API Limitations
- **Rate Limits**: Platform APIs may delay verification
- **Synchronization**: Some platforms have longer sync times
- **Cache Updates**: Recent actions may take time to appear
- **Platform Outages**: External platform issues can affect verification

### System Architecture
- **Redundant Checking**: Multiple verification attempts for reliability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of platform API failures
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for temporary verification failures
- **Monitoring**: Continuous system health monitoring

## User Support

### Verification Issues
- **Contact Support**: Report persistent verification problems
- **Documentation**: Detailed help available for common issues
- **Community Help**: User community provides peer support
- **Status Updates**: Regular communication about system issues

### Escalation Process
- **Level 1**: Automatic retry and troubleshooting
- **Level 2**: Community moderator review
- **Level 3**: Technical team investigation
- **Resolution**: Manual verification or task adjustment

The verification process ensures fair play while maintaining a smooth user experience. Most tasks verify quickly and automatically, while creative content receives thoughtful human review to maintain quality standards.
