## Understanding the Reward System

### Drops Distribution Model

| Mission Complexity | Tasks | Time Investment | Typical Reward |
|-------------------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Quickfire** | 3-5 | 10 minutes | 50-100 drops |
| **Standard** | 6-10 | 30 minutes | 100-300 drops |
| **Deep Dive** | 11-20 | 1-2 hours | 300-500 drops |
| **Marathon** | 20+ | 2+ hours | 500+ drops |

### The All-or-Nothing Principle

```
Reward Logic:
if (all_tasks_complete) {
  reward = mission_drops
} else {
  reward = 0
}
```

**No exceptions. No negotiations. Complete everything or receive nothing.**

### Tier System Breakdown

<Note>
**Most missions are single-tier** (Excellence only). Multi-tier missions are rare but offer flexibility.
</Note>

| Tier Level | Completion Required | Reward Percentage | Availability |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Participation** | 50-70% | 20-40% of max | Rare |
| **Excellence** | 100% | Full amount | All missions |
| **Bonus** | 100% + extras | 110-120% | Special events |

## The Bottom Line

### The Real Success Formula

> **Deep Understanding + Genuine Engagement = Meaningful Connections**
> 
> Drops are the reward, not the goal. Every mission is a structured introduction to a project's vision, their solution, their potential impact. When you truly understand what a project is building and why it matters, the tasks become explorations, not chores.
> 
> **This is the heartbeat of Bloom Protocol**: turning casual browsers into informed supporters, connecting builders with believers who actually understand their vision. The drops you earn are proof you took the time to learn, to engage, to understand.

### Why Understanding Matters More Than Drops

```
The Mission Journey:
Discover Project â†’ Understand Vision â†’ Complete Tasks â†’ Earn Drops
     â†“                    â†“                â†“              â†“
New knowledge      Real connection    Meaningful      Lasting
                                      engagement      value
```

Your genuine participation doesn't just earn you drops â€” it helps projects find their true supporters. And when you find a project whose vision resonates with you, those drops become tokens of a real relationship, not just points in a game.

### Quick Reference Card

```
Mission Philosophy:
â€¢ Understanding > Drops (learn first, earn second)
â€¢ Quality > Speed (depth matters more than rushing)
â€¢ Connection > Collection (relationships over points)
â€¢ Genuine > Gaming (real engagement wins)
â€¢ Discovery > Completion (explore, don't just execute)
```

<Success>
**Ready to discover?** Missions are structured introductions to innovative projects. Each task is a window into what builders are creating and why it matters. Approach them as learning opportunities, not just drop sources. When you find projects that resonate with your vision of the future, you've found something worth more than any amount of drops â€” you've found your tribe.
