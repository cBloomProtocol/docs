# What Are Missions

Missions are structured challenges on Bloom Protocol that reward you with drops (points) for completing specific tasks. Each mission contains a set of tasks you need to complete to claim your rewards.

## How Missions Work

### Finding Missions

Navigate to the Missions page to see all available missions. The page displays:
- Mission cards in a grid layout (3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
- Each card shows the mission title, reward amount, and number of tasks
- A "Claimed" badge appears on missions you've already completed

### Mission Status

Missions can have different states:
- **Available** - You can start and complete this mission
- **Claimed** - You've already completed and claimed rewards for this mission
- **Live** - Currently active and available to all users

## Starting a Mission

### Click to Begin
1. Click on any mission card to view its details
2. You'll see:
   - Mission overview and requirements
   - List of tasks organized by category
   - Reward information
   - Navigation to previous/next missions

### No Prerequisites
- Most missions are available to all users
- You don't need to complete them in order

## Understanding Mission Structure

### Task Organization

Tasks within missions are grouped by category for easy navigation:
