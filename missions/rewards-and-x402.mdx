title: "Rewards & X402 Payment System"
description: "How instant payments work and how to receive your rewards"
---

Social missions use X402 protocol for instant, direct payments. No claiming, no forms, no fees. Your public profile link becomes your payment address, and rewards flow automatically when approved.

## What is X402?

### The Payment Protocol

**X402** is an HTTP-based cryptocurrency payment protocol designed for the internet age.

Think of it like this:
- **PayPal**: Email = payment address (but centralized, takes fees)
- **Crypto**: Wallet address = payment address (but complicated, error-prone)
- **X402**: Public link = payment address (decentralized, instant, simple)

### How It Works

```
Traditional Crypto Payment:
1. "What's your wallet address?"
2. Copy: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
3. Paste (hope no typo)
4. Send transaction
5. Pay gas fees
6. Wait for confirmations
```

```
X402 Payment:
1. "What's your X402 link?"
2. Share: bloomprotocol.ai/alice
3. Instant payment via protocol
4. No fees
5. Direct to your wallet
```

## Payment Timeline

### From Submission to Reward

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Post on X">
    Include all requirements (@bloom_mission, project team, your profile link)
    **Time**: Instant (you control this)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Auto-Detection">
    System discovers your post via @bloom_mission mention
    **Time**: 3-10 minutes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validation">
    System checks: correct mentions, valid profile link, post is public
    **Time**: Instant (automated)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submission Created">
    Your submission enters "Pending Review" status
    **Time**: Instant (automated)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Human Review">
    Project team reviews your content quality and completion
    **Time**: Hours to 2 days (varies by project)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approval">
    Team approves your submission
    **Time**: Instant (human decision)
  </Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Timeline Expectations

| Phase | Typical Time | Fast Track | Slow Track |
|-------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Detection** | 3-5 minutes | 3 minutes | 10 minutes |
| **Validation** | Instant | Instant | Instant |
| **Review** | 12-24 hours | 1-2 hours | 2-7 days |

- Reward type (drops vs tokens have different processing)
- Mission volume (popular missions take longer to review)
</Note>

## Setting Up Your X402 Link

### Initial Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Profile">
    Log into Bloom Protocol platform and navigate to your profile settings
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find X402 Section">
    Look for "X402 Link", "Public Profile Link", or "Payment Settings"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Your Wallet">
    Link the wallet where you want to receive token rewards
    - MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or other Web3 wallets supported
    - This wallet receives partner token payments
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Your Link">
    System creates your unique link: `bloomprotocol.ai/[your-uid]`
    - UID is your unique user identifier
    - Example: `bloomprotocol.ai/47981824`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make It Public">
    Ensure your profile link is set to "Public" (not private)
    - X402 links must be publicly accessible
    - Test by opening in incognito browser
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Link">
    Copy and store it somewhere handy
    - You'll use it for every social mission submission
    - Add to your notes, password manager, or clipboard manager
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Testing Your Link

**Verification checklist**:

```
□ Open link in incognito/private browser
□ Profile page loads successfully
□ Public information is visible
□ No login required to view
□ Wallet address is connected
□ Link format is correct (no typos)
```

**If your link doesn't work**:
1. Check privacy settings (must be public)
2. Verify wallet is connected
3. Refresh your profile page
4. Clear browser cache
5. Contact support if issues persist

### Security Best Practices

<Warning>
**What to share**:
- ✓ Your X402 public profile link (bloomprotocol.ai/uid)
- ✓ Link in public X posts
- ✓ Link with mission teams

**What NEVER to share**:
- ✗ Your wallet private keys
- ✗ Your seed phrase/recovery phrase
- ✗ Your password
- ✗ Any sensitive account information

**Your X402 link is designed to be public**. It's safe to post on X. It only allows receiving payments, not sending.
</Warning>

## Reward Distribution Process

### For Bloom Drops

```
Approval → Instant Credit → Balance Updates → Visible in Dashboard
    ↓            ↓               ↓                    ↓

```

**Speed**: Instant (seconds)

**Where to check**:

```

**Speed**: Minutes to hours (blockchain dependent)

**Where to check**:
- Your connected wallet
- Blockchain explorer (Etherscan, etc.)
- Wallet transaction history

### Multiple Reward Missions

Some missions offer both drops and tokens:

```
Example Mission Rewards:
• 100 Bloom Drops
• 50 USDT

When Approved:
→ 100 drops added to Bloom account (instant)
→ 50 USDT sent to your wallet via X402 (minutes later)
```

## Anti-Fraud Protection

### The One-to-One Rule

Social missions prevent reward farming with a simple principle:

> **One person → One Twitter account → One submission per mission**

This ensures fair distribution and authentic engagement.

### What This Means for You

<Accordion title="You Can" icon="circle-check">

**Allowed actions**:
- ✓ Submit to multiple different missions
- ✓ Replace your submission with better content (same mission)
- ✓ Use same profile link across all missions
- ✓ Participate from any device
- ✓ Take as long as you need (within deadline)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You Cannot" icon="circle-xmark">

**Prevented actions**:
- ✗ Submit from multiple Twitter accounts (same mission)
- ✗ Use someone else's profile link
- ✗ Switch profile links mid-submission
- ✗ Create fake submissions with AI
- ✗ Copy other users' submissions

</Accordion>

### Enforcement

**System automatically**:
1. Validates UID exists in database
2. Checks Twitter account hasn't submitted already
3. Ensures profile link hasn't been used by different account
4. Prevents duplicate submissions

**Result of violation**:
- Submission rejected
- Error message explains the issue
- No impact on other valid submissions
- Can correct and resubmit properly

## Payment FAQs

### Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I pay gas fees to receive rewards?" icon="gas-pump">

**No.**

For Bloom Drops: No blockchain transaction, so no fees at all.

For partner tokens via X402: The sender (project) pays gas fees, not you. You receive the full reward amount directly to your wallet.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change my wallet address?" icon="wallet">

**Yes, but carefully.**

You can update the wallet connected to your X402 profile link in your profile settings.

**Important**:
- Changes apply to future payments only
- Ongoing mission submissions use the wallet linked when you submitted
- Always verify new wallet is connected correctly before submitting new missions

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I don't receive payment?" icon="circle-question">

**Troubleshooting steps**:

1. **Check approval status**: Is submission actually approved?
2. **Wait 24 hours**: Some token transfers take time
3. **Verify wallet**: Is correct wallet connected to your profile?
4. **Check blockchain**: Look up transaction on Etherscan
5. **Profile link active**: Test your link in incognito browser
6. **Contact support**: After 48 hours, report the issue

**Most common cause**: Wallet not properly connected or profile link set to private.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I receive payments in different cryptocurrencies?" icon="coins">

**You receive whatever the mission offers.**

- Mission specifies reward type (USDT, USDC, project token, etc.)
- Your wallet must support that token's blockchain
- Example: USDT on Ethereum requires Ethereum-compatible wallet
- Check mission details before submitting to ensure compatibility

**Cannot customize**: You can't request different token than what's offered.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are rewards taxable?" icon="landmark">

**Probably yes, but consult a tax professional.**

In most jurisdictions:
- Crypto rewards are considered taxable income
- Value is calculated at time of receipt
- You're responsible for reporting
- Tax laws vary by country

**We don't provide tax advice.** Consult a qualified tax professional in your jurisdiction.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens to unclaimed rewards?" icon="clock">

**For social missions: No claiming needed.**

Unlike traditional missions, social mission rewards are distributed automatically upon approval. There's no "claim" step.

Your rewards are either:
- **Drops**: Already in your account
- **Tokens**: Already sent to your wallet

If you don't receive them, it's a technical issue (see "What if I don't receive payment?" above), not an unclaimed reward.

## Reward Maximization Tips

### Strategic Approach

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Quality First">

**High-quality submissions earn more**:
- Projects remember valuable contributors
- Future missions may offer higher rewards
- Some projects invite top performers directly
- Quality builds reputation across platform

**Investment**: Extra hour on submission → 2-5x reward opportunities

</Tab>
<Tab title="Portfolio Building">

**Your public X timeline becomes your portfolio**:
- All approved submissions visible on your X
- Projects can see your contribution history
- Demonstrates expertise in specific areas
- Creates passive discovery (projects find you)

**Benefit**: Inbound opportunities from quality work

</Tab>
<Tab title="Relationship Building">

**Genuine engagement opens doors**:
- Follow projects you genuinely like
- Join their communities beyond missions
- Provide ongoing feedback, not just for rewards
- Build relationships with team members

**Result**: Early access to new missions, higher trust, better rewards

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Long-Term Value

> **Beyond immediate rewards**:
>
> Social missions create compound value:
> 1. **Immediate**: Drops and tokens from completion
> 2. **Short-term**: Reputation on platform, invitation to more missions
> 3. **Medium-term**: Projects reach out directly, skipping public missions
> 4. **Long-term**: Portfolio of public contributions, industry connections
>
> The users earning the most aren't rushing through missions. They're building genuine relationships with projects they believe in.
