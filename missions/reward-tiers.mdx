# Reward Tiers

Bloom Protocol missions offer structured rewards based on completion and participation. Here's how the reward system works:

## Mission Completion Rewards

### Instant Reward Claiming
- Complete all tasks within a mission to unlock rewards
- Rewards are claimed instantly when all tasks are finished
- One-time completion system - each mission can only be claimed once per user

### Reward Types
- **Drops**: Primary reward points displayed in your navigation bar
- **Mini Points**: Secondary reward currency for specific missions
- **Special Badges**: Proof of completion for milestone missions

## Task-Based Progression

### Individual Task Completion
- Each task within a mission can be completed independently
- Tasks are organized by categories (e.g., "Social Media", "Community Engagement")
- Progress is tracked in real-time with visual indicators

### Task States
- **Pending**: Task not yet started (purple "Start" button)
- **In Progress**: Task submitted and being verified (gray "Processing" button)
- **Completed**: Task successfully verified (green "Completed" button)
- **Failed**: Task verification failed (red "Retry" button)

## Mission Categories

### Daily Missions
- Recurring tasks that reset daily
- Lower point values but consistent earning opportunities
- Focus on community engagement and platform interaction

### Special Events
- Limited-time missions with higher rewards
- Often tied to platform milestones or partnerships
- Exclusive badges and higher point multipliers

### Community Challenges
- Group-based missions requiring collective participation
- Bonus rewards for community-wide completion goals
- Unlock special features or access levels

## Reward Distribution

### Automatic Processing
- Rewards are automatically added to your account upon task completion
- Real-time updates to your drops balance
- No manual claiming required for individual tasks

### Verification System
- Automated verification for most tasks (following, liking, sharing)
- Manual review for content creation tasks
- Typical verification time: 1-5 minutes for automated tasks

## Maximizing Rewards

### Strategy Tips
1. **Complete Full Missions**: Higher point bonuses for completing all tasks
2. **Consistent Participation**: Daily engagement increases overall earning potential
3. **Quality Content**: Creative tasks receive bonus points for high-quality submissions
4. **Early Participation**: Some missions offer early-bird bonuses

### Progress Tracking
- View completion status on individual mission pages
- Dashboard shows overall mission progress and statistics
- Filter by task type (All, Task, Referral Activity) to track specific areas
