## Our Vision
Product-led builders globally can raise funds, validate ideas, and grow with community — aligned with their earliest believers.

## Summary

Bloom Protocol is building the Early Capital Formation Layer — the platform that helps builders find, activate, and filter their first true supporters before fundraising from other token launchers/launchpads.

We help projects build community capital (attention, feedback, advocacy) first, making financial capital meaningful when it follows.

## How It Works

### For Supporters
As a supporter, you can:
- **Explore innovative projects** before they hit mainstream
- **Earn rewards and points** for early participation
- **Build your reputation** as an early adopter and trendsetter

### For Builders
If you're building the next big thing, Bloom Protocol provides you with:
- **Direct access to early supporters** who believe in your vision
- **Community-driven funding** without traditional barriers
- **Builder tools** to manage your project and engage with supporters

## Core Features

### Project Spotlight
Featured projects are carefully curated and showcased, giving builders maximum visibility and supporters the best opportunities to discover groundbreaking initiatives.

### Points & Rewards
Every action on Bloom Protocol earns you points:
- Engage with projects through bookmarking, thoughtful comments, and task
  participation
- Complete missions that challenge you to explore new
  features and discover innovative projects
- Expand the ecosystem by referring friends who share your vision for supporting
  early-stage innovation

### Mission
We work closely with project teams to create meaningful tasks that go beyond clicking buttons. When you complete missions, you're helping projects validate ideas and grow — while earning rewards for your real contributions. It's a win-win where your active participation shapes project development.

## Our Community

Traditional platforms treat builders and supporters as opposite sides of a transaction. We see them differently.

In Bloom Protocol's ecosystem, the best supporters become builders themselves — launching spin-offs, creating complementary tools, or evolving into advisors. Meanwhile, successful builders often become the most passionate supporters of the next wave, reinvesting their knowledge and capital into emerging projects they understand deeply.

This creates a regenerative cycle where roles blur and value compounds. Today's supporter commenting on your project might become tomorrow's technical co-founder. Today's builder seeking validation might become tomorrow's mentor to dozens of new projects.

What emerges is not just a community, but a living network where expertise flows freely, reputation travels with you, and every interaction plants seeds for future collaboration. We're cultivating an ecosystem where success isn't extracted — it's recycled, amplified, and shared.
