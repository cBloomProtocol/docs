**First thing, regiester an account on [Bloom Protocol](https://preflight.bloomprotocol.ai).**

For a existed mission, create a post on X ( previously Twitter ) with 2+1 elements.
<br /><br />**That's it.**

  Just spent 30min testing @ProjectTeam's new dashboard.

  What worked well:
  • Onboarding flow is smooth (3 steps, took 2min)
  • Dark mode is 🔥
  • Transaction history loads fast

  What could improve:
  • Export button is hard to find
  • Mobile view cuts off some text
  • Would love batch actions

  Overall: Solid update! 8/10

## What if my post ( submission ) is a thread 😳 ?
<Note>
All 2+1 elements must be in the first post of your thread.
</Note>

You **must include the 2+1 elements in the first post.**


**Example of correct thread structure:**

## The 2+1 Elements

Every social mission submission requires two essential elements. Miss any one, and your submission won't be detected or approved.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="@bloom_mission">

**What**: Include @bloom_mission in your post

**Why**: This is how our system discovers your submission when scanning X

**Format**: Type it exactly as `@bloom_mission` (lowercase, with underscore)

**Example Post**:
```
Just completed the awesome challenge from @ProjectTeam!
Here's my detailed feedback 👇
@bloom_mission
```

<Warning>
**Common mistakes**:
- Writing `@bloom-mission` (dash instead of underscore)
- Writing `@bloomprotocol` (different account)
- Forgetting to include it entirely
</Warning>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Dev Team Account">

**What**: Mention the project's X account specified in the mission details

**Why**: Connects your submission to the specific mission and notifies the project team

**Where to find it**: Look for "Dev Team" or "Project Account" in the mission details page

**Example from mission page**:
```
Mission by: Seedify (@Bloom__Protocol)
You must mention: @Bloom__Protocol
```

**Example Post**:
```
Testing the latest feature on @Bloom__Protocol's website.
The UX is incredibly smooth! Full review: [link]

```

<Note>
Different missions may posted by different project accounts. Always check the which account posting the mission. 🫡
</Note>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

For your Bloom Protcol Public Page Link, 
<Tip>
[Connect your X ( previously Twitter ) account in settings](https://preflight.bloomprotocol.ai/profile/x402)
</Tip>
Otherwise, you must include your public profile link in your post.
**By the way, this link is the key to receive rewards 😎**

## Can I Submit Multiple Times?

**Yes! You can improve your submission by end of time.**

This is one of the best features of social missions - you're not locked into your first attempt.

<Check>**You can**: Submit as many improved versions as you want before deadline</Check>
<Check>**You can**: Replace even after initial approval (if deadline hasn't passed)</Check>
<Check>**System automatically**: Keeps only your latest submission</Check>

<Warning>
**You cannot**:
- Submit from multiple Twitter accounts for the same mission
- Use different profile links (UIDs) for the same mission
- Replace after the mission deadline has passed
- Submit the same exact post URL multiple times
</Warning>
