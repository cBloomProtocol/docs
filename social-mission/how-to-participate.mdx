Participating in social missions is simple: post on X with the **2+1** elements, and Bloom Protocol handles the rest.

**The 2+1 elements:**
<Check>@bloom_mission</Check>
<Check>Project team account mention</Check>
<Note>Your public profile link (if Twitter not connected)</Note>


## Good Submission Example

A good submission must include the two required elements: the mission account mention (@bloom_mission) 
and the project team account mention. If you haven't connected your X ( previously Twitter ) account yet, 
also include your public profile page link. <br /><br />
Here's what a complete submission looks like:

```
"Just spent 30min testing @ProjectX's new dashboard.

What worked well:
• Onboarding flow is smooth (3 steps, took 2min)
• Dark mode is 🔥
• Transaction history loads fast

What could improve:
• Export button is hard to find
• Mobile view cuts off some text
• Would love batch actions

Overall: Solid update! 8/10

**Just to remind you ☺️**
<Tip>If you had connect X account when configuring you public page, you don't need to include the link in the post</Tip>

## What if my post ( submission ) is a thread 😳 ?
<Note>
All 2+1 elements must be in the first post of your thread.
</Note>

You **must include the 2+1 elements in the first post.**


**Example of correct thread structure:**
```
Post 1 (First post):
"🧵 My detailed analysis of @ProjectX's new feature

[Your opening content...]

@bloom_mission [Your Blomm Protcol Pulic Profil Page Link]

Post 2, 3, 4... (Continuation):
[Rest of your detailed analysis, screenshots, insights...]
```

## The 2+1 Elements

Every social mission submission requires two essential elements. Miss any one, and your submission won't be detected or approved.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="@bloom_mission">

**What**: Include @bloom_mission in your post

**Why**: This is how our system discovers your submission when scanning X

**Format**: Type it exactly as `@bloom_mission` (lowercase, with underscore)

**Example Post**:
```
Just completed the awesome challenge from @ProjectTeam!
Here's my detailed feedback 👇
@bloom_mission
```

<Warning>
**Common mistakes**:
- Writing `@bloom-mission` (dash instead of underscore)
- Writing `@bloomprotocol` (different account)
- Forgetting to include it entirely
</Warning>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Dev Team Account">

**What**: Mention the project's X account specified in the mission details

**Why**: Connects your submission to the specific mission and notifies the project team

**Where to find it**: Look for "Dev Team" or "Project Account" in the mission details page

**Example from mission page**:
```
Mission by: Seedify (@Bloom__Protocol)
You must mention: @Bloom__Protocol
```

**Example Post**:
```
Testing the latest feature on @Bloom__Protocol's website.
The UX is incredibly smooth! Full review: [link]

<Note>
Different missions may posted by different project accounts. Always check the which account posting the mission. 🫡

</AccordionGroup>

For your Bloom Protcol Public Page Link, 
<Tip>
[Connect your X ( previously Twitter ) account in settings](https://preflight.bloomprotocol.ai/profile/x402)
</Tip>
Otherwise, you must include your public profile link in your post.
**By the way, this link is the key to receive rewards 😎**

## Can I Submit Multiple Times?

**Yes! You can improve your submission by end of time.**

This is one of the best features of social missions - you're not locked into your first attempt.

<Check>**You can**: Submit as many improved versions as you want before deadline</Check>
<Check>**You can**: Replace even after initial approval (if deadline hasn't passed)</Check>
<Check>**System automatically**: Keeps only your latest submission</Check>

<Warning>
**You cannot**:
- Submit from multiple Twitter accounts for the same mission
- Use different profile links (UIDs) for the same mission
- Replace after the mission deadline has passed
- Submit the same exact post URL multiple times
</Warning>
