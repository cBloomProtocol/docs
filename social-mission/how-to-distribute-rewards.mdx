title: "How to Distribute Rewards"
description: "A complete guide for builders to distribute Drop and Token rewards to mission participants"
---

This guide walks you through distributing rewards to participants who completed your social mission. Bloom Protocol supports two types of rewards:

- **Drops**: Platform points distributed instantly upon approval
- **Token Rewards**: Stablecoins (USDT/USDC) that you transfer to participants

---

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- An active social mission with submissions
- Access to the Builder Dashboard
- For token rewards: Stablecoins ready in your wallet

<Warning>
**For Token Rewards**: Participants must configure their x402 payment address in Bloom Protocol settings to receive stablecoins. Those without a configured wallet will be skipped during token distribution.
</Warning>

---

## Part 1: Drop Rewards

Drops are Bloom Protocol's internal reward points. You have two options for distributing drops:

### Option A: Automatic Distribution (Recommended)

Enable automatic drop distribution so participants receive drops instantly when you approve their submissions.

1. Go to your mission's **Builder Dashboard**
2. Find the **Mission Settings** card
3. Under **Approval and Reward**, enable **"Distribute drops when approved"**

<Tip>
When this toggle is enabled, every time you approve a submission, drops are automatically distributed to that participant. No manual action needed!
</Tip>

### Option B: Manual Distribution

If you prefer to review all submissions first and distribute drops in batches:

1. Keep **"Distribute drops when approved"** disabled
2. Review and approve submissions
3. Find the **Distribute Drop Reward** card in the right sidebar
4. Click **"Distribute All Drops"** to send drops to all approved submissions

<Note>
The "Distribute Drop Reward" card only appears when automatic distribution is disabled.
</Note>

## Part 2: Token Rewards (Stablecoins)

Token rewards are actual stablecoins sent to participants' wallets. This requires you to configure reward settings and transfer tokens.

### Step 1: Configure Token Reward Settings

1. Go to your mission's **Builder Dashboard**
2. Find the **Mission Settings** card
3. Under the **Reward** section, locate **Stablecoin Reward**
4. Click **Edit** or configure:
   - **Chain**: Base, BSC (BNB Chain)
   - **Token**: USDC or USDT (depends on chain)
   - **Amount**: Reward amount per submission (e.g., 10)
5. Click **Save**

**Supported configurations:**
| Chain | Default Token | Options |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Base | USDC | USDC, USDT |
| BSC | USDT | USDT, USDC |

<Tip>
Choose a chain where you already have tokens available. Base is recommended for lower gas fees.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Review and Approve Submissions

Only approved submissions are eligible for token rewards.

1. Go to your mission's **Submissions** section
2. Review each submission
3. Click **Approve** for quality submissions
4. Click **Reject** for submissions that don't meet requirements

<Note>
Once you distribute token rewards, the submissions become locked and cannot be changed.
</Note>

### Step 3: Initiate Token Distribution

1. Find the **Distribute Token Reward** card in the right sidebar
2. Review the distribution summary:
   - **Token**: The stablecoin and chain you configured
   - **Per Submission**: Amount each participant receives
   - **Eligible Submissions**: Number of approved submissions with configured x402 wallets
   - **Total Amount**: Total tokens required
   - **Service Fee**: Free
3. Click **"Distribute Token Reward"**

### Step 4: Transfer Tokens to Platform Wallet

After clicking distribute, you'll see:
- The **Platform Wallet Address**
- The **exact amount** to transfer
- The **chain and token** to use

**Transfer the tokens:**

1. Open your wallet (MetaMask, Phantom, OKX Wallet, etc.)
2. Ensure you're on the correct network (Base or BSC)
3. Send the **exact amount** shown to the platform wallet
4. Wait for the transaction to confirm on-chain

<Warning>
**Send the exact amount shown.** Sending less will cause verification to fail.
</Warning>

### Step 5: Confirm Your Transfer

Once your transfer is complete:

1. Copy the **transaction hash** from your wallet
2. Paste it into the **"Transaction Hash"** field
3. Click **"Confirm Transfer"**

The system will verify your transaction on-chain. This usually takes 1-2 minutes.

### Step 6: Automatic Distribution

After verification succeeds:
- The system automatically sends tokens to all eligible participants
- Each participant receives tokens directly to their x402 wallet
- You can track distribution history in the **Token Distribution Status** card

---

## Tracking Distribution Status

The **Token Distribution Status** card shows:
- **Pending**: Awaiting your payment
- **Processing**: Distributing to participants
- **Completed**: All tokens sent successfully
- **Failed**: Issues during distribution
