title: "How to Distribute Token Rewards"
description: "A step-by-step guide for project teams to distribute token rewards to mission participants"
---

This guide walks you through distributing token rewards to participants who completed your social mission.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- An active social mission with approved submissions
- Tokens (USDT or USDC) ready in your wallet
- Access to the Builder Dashboard

<Warning>
**Important**: Participants must have configured their wallet address in Bloom Protocol settings to receive rewards. Those without a wallet setup will be skipped during distribution.
</Warning>

---

## Step 1: Configure Your Reward Settings

Before distributing rewards, you need to set up your reward configuration.

1. Go to your **Builder Dashboard**
2. Find your mission and click **Mission Settings**
3. Under the **Reward** section:
   - Select the **blockchain network**:
     - **Base** (default: USDC)
     - **BSC / BNB Chain** (default: USDT)
     - **Solana** (default: USDC)
   - Confirm the **token** type
   - Enter the **amount per submission** (e.g., 10 USDC)
4. Click **Save**

<Tip>
Choose a network where you already have tokens available. This makes the transfer process easier.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Review and Approve Submissions

Only approved submissions are eligible for token rewards.

1. Go to your mission's **Submissions** tab
2. Review each submission carefully
3. Click **Approve** for quality submissions
4. Click **Reject** for submissions that don't meet your requirements

<Note>
Take your time reviewing. Once you distribute rewards, approved submissions become locked and cannot be changed.
</Note>

---

## Step 3: Start the Distribution

1. In your mission dashboard, find the **Distribute Token Reward** section
2. Click **Distribute Token Reward**
3. The system will calculate:
   - Number of eligible participants (approved submissions with wallet setup)
   - Total token amount required

**Example**: If you set 10 USDT per submission and have 15 eligible participants, the total is 150 USDT.

---

## Step 4: Transfer Tokens to Platform Wallet

After clicking distribute, you'll see:
- The **platform wallet address**
- The **exact amount** to transfer
- The **network and token** to use

**What to do**:

1. Open your wallet app (e.g., MetaMask, Phantom, OKX Wallet)
2. Make sure you're on the correct network (Base, BSC, or Solana)
3. Send the **exact amount** to the platform wallet address
4. Wait for the transaction to confirm on the blockchain

<Warning>
**Send the exact amount shown**. Sending less will cause verification to fail. Sending more is okay but won't be refunded automatically.
</Warning>

---

## Step 5: Confirm Your Transfer

Once your on-chain transfer is complete:

1. Copy the **transaction hash** from your wallet
2. Paste it into the **Transaction Hash** field
3. Click **Confirm Transfer**

The system will verify your transaction on the blockchain. This usually takes about 1-2 minutes.

---

## Step 6: Automatic Distribution

After verification succeeds:
- The system automatically sends rewards to all eligible participants
- Each participant receives tokens directly to their configured wallet
- You can track the distribution progress in your dashboard

**That's it!** Your participants will receive their rewards shortly.
