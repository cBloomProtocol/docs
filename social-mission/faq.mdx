## Common Issues
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="My post isn't showing up after 10+ minutes" icon="magnifying-glass">

**Most common causes**:

1. **Missing @bloom_mission mention**
   - Check your post, add mention if missing, or post a new one.

2. **Incorrect mention format**
   - Problem: Using @bloom-mission (dash) instead of @bloom_mission (underscore)
   - Solution: Post a new one.

4. **Post is a reply, not main tweet**
   - Problem: that reply didn't include the [2+1 elements](/social-mission/how-to-participate)
   - Solution: Post as main tweet, not reply to another post

**Action steps**:
```
1. Verify all 3 requirements in your post:
   □ @bloom_mission (with underscore)
   □ Project team mention
   □ Your profile link

2. Use Manual Submission on mission page

3. File a ticket in our discord community
```

**Manual Submission**:
- Go to mission detail page
- Find "Manual Submission" card
- Paste your X post URL
- Click Submit

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stuck in 'Pending Review' for days" icon="clock">

**Normal timeline**: 24-48 hours for most missions

**Why it might take longer**:
- High volume of submissions (popular missions)
- Project team timezone differences
- Weekends/holidays
- Additional verification needed
- Complex missions requiring thorough review

**When to be concerned**: After 72 hours (3 days)

**What to do**:

1. **Verify mission is still active**
   - Check deadline hasn't passed
   - Confirm mission wasn't cancelled

2. **Review your submission quality**
   - Does it meet all requirements?
   - Is content quality sufficient?
   - Did you provide evidence/proof?

3. **Check for project updates**
   - Look at mission page for announcements
   - Check project's X account for updates
   - See if other submissions are being approved

4. **Contact support after 3+ days**
   - Include your X post URL
   - Include mission name/ID
   - Describe what you submitted
   - Attach screenshots

**Pro tip**: Study the mission creator more before participating.
**Pro tip**: Quality submissions get reviewed faster. If yours is thorough, has evidence, and clearly meets requirements, it's likely just in queue.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Approved but haven't received rewards" icon="coins">

**Check these first**:

1. **Drops (Bloom points)**
   - Check your dashboard balance
   - Look at navigation bar (top right)
   - Verify in profile transaction history
   - Should be instant upon approval

2. **Partner tokens (USDT, etc.)**
   - Check your wallet (not Bloom platform)
   - Wait 24 hours (blockchain transactions take time)
   - Verify correct wallet is connected
   - Check blockchain explorer for transaction

**Troubleshooting steps**:

```
Step 1: Verify approval
□ Mission page shows "Approved" status
□ Submission appears in approved list
□ Confirmation received

Step 2: Check correct location
□ Drops → Bloom dashboard
□ Tokens → Your wallet assigned to collect payments for your public page
```

**Most common issue**: Wallet not properly connected to X402 profile link. Go to profile settings and verify wallet connection.

<Accordion title="Why was my submission rejected?" icon="ban">

**Common rejection reasons**:

| Reason | What Happened | How to Avoid |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **AI-generated content** | Detected ChatGPT/Claude patterns | Write yourself, show authentic voice |
| **Generic feedback** | Too vague, no specifics | Include details, screenshots, examples |
| **Didn't complete task** | No evidence of actual work | Actually test/use the product |
| **Copied content** | Plagiarized from others | Create original content |
| **Spam-like** | Low effort, template responses | Put in genuine effort |
| **Requirements not met** | Missing mission-specific criteria | Read requirements carefully |
| **Poor quality** | Unprofessional, errors, unclear | Proofread, format properly |

**What to do after rejection**:

1. **Don't repeat mistakes**: Understand what was insufficient
2. **Improve quality**: Next submission should address the issues

**Can you resubmit?**: Depending on the mission rules.

**Appeal process**: If you believe rejection was unfair, contact the mission creator ( project team ) with evidence.

## About Submissions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I delete my submission?" icon="trash">

**Short answer**: No direct delete, but you can replace it.

**How replacement works**:
- Post a new submission with same requirements
- System automatically replaces old submission
- Old post archived in system
- Only latest submission counts

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I submit the same content to multiple missions?" icon="copy">

Same content? **Not recommended**, and often against rules.

**Why it's problematic**:
- Each project wants unique, tailored feedback
- Generic content usually gets rejected
- Projects can see your other submissions
- Damages your reputation

**Better approach**:
- Customize content for each project
- Address their specific requirements
- Show you understand their unique product
- Build quality over quantity

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to follow the project on X?" icon="user-plus">

**Not required by system, but highly recommended.**

**Why you should**:
- Shows genuine interest
- Projects may check follower status
- You'll see important mission updates
- Community engagement looks better
- Some missions may require it explicitly

**Check mission requirements**: Some missions do explicitly require following.

## About Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How long do rewards take?" icon="stopwatch">

It depends, if the Bloom Protocol is the mission creator, then the drops and the token rewards should be fast.
<br />
But if the mission is not created by us...
**Typical timeline once your submission is approved**:

| Reward Type | Normal | Fast | Slow |
|------------|--------|------|------|
| **Bloom Drops** | Instant | Instant | Instant |
| **USDT/USDC** | we don't know | we don't know | we don't know |


</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I choose which wallet receives tokens?" icon="wallet">

**Yes, through your [settings](https://preflight.bloomprotocol.ai/profile/x402).**

**Important notes**:
- Changes apply to future payments

- Verify wallet supports token's blockchain
- Keep wallet secure and accessible

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there minimum payout amounts?" icon="dollar-sign">

**For Bloom Drops**: No minimum. Every drop counts.

**For partner tokens**: Depends on the mission creator ( project team ).
- You should ask the mission creator ( project team ) directly
- Most missions pay immediately regardless of amount

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I lost access to my wallet?" icon="key">

**Before you receive payment**:
1. Update wallet in [settings](https://preflight.bloomprotocol.ai/profile/x402) immediately
2. Contact mission team if urgent

Remember, not your key, not yours.
