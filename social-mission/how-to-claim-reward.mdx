No claiming needed. When your submission is approved, rewards are sent automatically—either processed by Bloom Protocol or distributed directly by the project team.


## Requirements

To receive rewards, you need to:
1. Register an account on Bloom Protocol
2. Connect your X account in [settings](https://preflight.bloomprotocol.ai/profile/x402)
3. Configure the payment collection wallet address in [settings](https://preflight.bloomprotocol.ai/profile/x402)

<Tip>
Once you've connected your X account, our system automatically scans for any submissions you've made—no extra steps needed.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Important**: Projects may distribute rewards on different chains. If a project sends rewards on Ethereum but you registered with Solana, you'll need to configure an EVM wallet address in your settings to receive those rewards.
</Warning>
