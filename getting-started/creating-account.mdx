# Creating Your Account

Getting started with Bloom Protocol is simple. You'll need to connect a wallet and verify you're human. The entire process takes less than a minute.

## Supported Wallets

### Mobile Wallets
If you're on mobile, we support:
- **Phantom** - Most popular Solana wallet
- **OKX Wallet** - Multi-chain wallet with excellent Solana support

### Desktop Wallets
On desktop, we auto-detect and support:
- **Phantom** 
- **OKX Wallet**
- **Backpack**
- **Solflare**

<Info>
**Don't have a wallet?** We recommend [Phantom](https://phantom.app) for first-time users. It's available on iOS, Android, and as a browser extension.
</Info>

## Connection Process

### Step 1: Click Connect Wallet

Look for the "Connect Wallet" button in the navigation menu. Clicking it opens the authentication modal.

### Step 2: Human Verification

You'll see a Cloudflare Turnstile widget to verify you're human. This helps prevent bots and ensures a fair platform for everyone.

<Note>
In development mode, you may see a "Skip Verification" button if Turnstile isn't configured.
</Note>

### Step 3: Choose Your Authentication Method

After verification, you'll see your authentication options:

#### Wallet Connection (Recommended)
- **On Mobile**: Select Phantom or OKX Wallet. You'll be redirected to the app.
- **On Desktop**: Choose from detected wallets. A popup will ask you to approve the connection.

#### Email/Google Login
If you prefer not to use a wallet directly, you can login with:
- Email address
- Google account

This creates an embedded wallet for you behind the scenes.

### Step 4: Sign the Message

After selecting your wallet, you'll need to sign a message to prove ownership. This is free and doesn't cost any gas.

### Step 5: Account Creation

If this is your first time, we'll automatically:
1. Create your Bloom Protocol account
2. Link it to your wallet address
3. Generate your authentication token
4. Set up your default role (Supporter)

If you have a referral code, it will be automatically applied during registration.

## After Connecting

Once connected, you'll have access to:

### Your Dashboard
- View your points balance
- Track your mission progress
- See your supported projects
- Monitor your referrals

### Role Selection
By default, you start as a **Supporter**. You can switch to **Builder** mode anytime from your profile if you want to launch a project.

### Profile Setup
While not required, we recommend:
- Adding a profile picture
- Setting a display name
- Verifying your email for notifications

## Wallet Management

### Switching Wallets
To switch wallets:
1. Disconnect your current wallet
2. Connect with a different wallet
3. Your account data remains linked to each wallet address

### Disconnecting
You can disconnect anytime by:
- Clicking your profile icon
- Selecting "Disconnect"

This logs you out but doesn't delete your account.

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Not Detected
**Desktop Issue**: Make sure your wallet extension is:
- Installed and enabled
- Unlocked
- Set to Solana network

**Mobile Issue**: Ensure you have the wallet app installed

### Connection Failed
Common solutions:
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check your wallet is unlocked
- Clear browser cache
- Try a different browser

### Verification Stuck
If Turnstile verification doesn't load:
- Check your internet connection
- Disable ad blockers temporarily
- Try incognito/private mode

### Transaction Errors
If signing fails:
- Ensure you have at least 0.001 SOL for fees
- Check you're on Solana mainnet
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

## Security Tips

### Keep Your Wallet Safe
- **Never share** your seed phrase or private keys
- **Verify the URL** - always connect on bloomprotocol.ai
- **Check permissions** before signing transactions

### Account Security
- Use a hardware wallet for large holdings
- Enable 2FA if you verify your email
- Regularly check your connected apps in your wallet
