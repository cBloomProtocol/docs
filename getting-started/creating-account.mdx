Getting started with Bloom Protocol takes less than a minute. You'll just need to verify you're human and choose your preferred authentication method.

<Tip>
We recommend using Chrome browser on both desktop and mobile for the best experience.

## Supported Wallets

| Platform | Wallets |
|----------|---------|
| **Mobile** | Phantom, OKX Wallet |
| **Desktop** | Phantom, OKX Wallet, Backpack, Solflare |

<Info>
**Don't have a wallet?** We recommend [Phantom](https://phantom.app) for first-time users. It's available on iOS, Android, and as a browser extension.
</Info>

## Connection Process

### Step 1: Click Connect Wallet

Look for the "Connect" button in the navigation menu. The location varies by device:

**Desktop View**
The Connect button appears in the top-right corner of the navigation bar.

### Step 2: Human Verification

We'll check if you're a bot or a real person. As long as you're human, this check will pass and you can choose your login method. If you're human but mistakenly flagged as a bot, simply try again.

Since human verification is essential for security, you may need to wait a moment for the verification process to complete.

### Step 3: Choose Your Authentication Method

After verification, you'll see your authentication options:

<Note>
**Important**: Remember which method you use to sign in. Your account data is tied to your authentication method, so using the same method ensures you access the same account across all devices.
</Note>

#### Wallet Connection (Recommended)
- **On Mobile**: Select Phantom or OKX Wallet. You'll be redirected to the app.
- **On Desktop**: Choose from detected wallets. A popup will ask you to approve the connection.

#### Email/Google Login
If you prefer not to use a wallet directly, you can login with:
- Email address
- Google account

This creates an embedded wallet for you behind the scenes.

### Step 4: Sign the Message

After selecting your wallet, you'll need to sign a message to prove ownership. This is free and doesn't cost any gas.

### Step 5: Account Creation

If this is your first time, we'll automatically:
1. Create your Bloom Protocol account
2. Link it to your wallet address
3. Set up your default role (Supporter)

If you registered through someone's referral link, they will receive points when you complete your registration.

## After Connecting

Once connected, you'll have access to:

### Your Dashboard
- View your points balance
- Track your mission progress
- See your supported projects
- Monitor your referrals

### Role Selection
By default, you start as a **Supporter**.

<Info>
The ability to switch to **Builder** mode will be enabled in a future release for those who want to launch projects.
</Info>

### Disconnecting
You can disconnect anytime by:
- Click your profile icon
- Select "Disconnect"

This logs you out but doesn't delete your account.

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Not Detected
**Desktop Issue**: Make sure your wallet extension is:
- Installed and enabled
- Unlocked
- Set to Solana network

**Mobile Issue**: Ensure you have the wallet app installed

### Connection Failed
Wallet connections on mobile devices aren't always as seamless as traditional email or SSO login. The process involves switching between apps and granting permissions, which can occasionally fail.

Common solutions:
- Be patient - the connection may take a few moments
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check your wallet is unlocked
- Clear browser cache

### Verification Stuck
Cloudflare's verification is an industry-proven security service that protects our platform. If verification fails, it's determined entirely by Cloudflare's advanced algorithms - we cannot override or diagnose their decisions.

This system helps ensure Bloom Protocol remains a genuine community for real users and builders, not professional airdrop hunters or bot farms. If you're a real user experiencing issues, simply try again later.
