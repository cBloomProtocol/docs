## The 5-Step Connection Process

```
Connection Flow:
1. Locate Connect Button → Top-right navigation
2. Pass Human Check → Cloudflare Turnstile
3. Choose Auth Method → Wallet or Email
4. Sign Message → Prove ownership
5. Welcome Aboard → Start earning
```

### Step 1: Find Your Entry Point

> **Button Location Guide:**
> - **Desktop**: Top-right corner of navigation bar
> - **Mobile**: Center of navigation bar (not in hamburger menu)
> - **Tablet**: Same as desktop layout

### Step 2: Human Verification

**The Bot Barrier**

Cloudflare Turnstile stands guard. It's quick, usually invisible, occasionally annoying.

| Verification Result | What Happens | Your Action |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Instant Pass** | Proceeds automatically | Continue to wallet |
| **Challenge Required** | Simple puzzle appears | Complete it |
| **Failed Attempt** | Red error message | Try again |
| **Repeated Failures** | Temporary block | Wait 5 minutes |

### Step 3: Authentication Routes

<Warning>
**One account per method**. Switching between wallet and email creates separate accounts. These cannot be merged. Choose wisely.
</Warning>

#### Route A: Wallet Connection (Recommended)

```
Wallet Flow:
├── Mobile Path
│   ├── Tap wallet option
│   ├── App opens automatically
│   └── Approve in wallet app
└── Desktop Path
    ├── Click wallet option
    ├── Browser popup appears
    └── Approve in extension
```

**Why wallet?** True ownership, no passwords, seamless Web3 integration.

#### Route B: Email/Google Login

```
Email Flow:
├── Click email option
├── Enter credentials
└── Verify if needed
```

**Why email?** Familiar process, no wallet setup, perfect for beginners.

### Step 4: Message Signing

| What You See | What It Means | Cost |
|--------------|---------------|------|
| "Sign this message" popup | Proving you control the address | **$0.00** |
| Transaction details | Just verification, not a payment | **Zero gas** |
| Wallet confirmation | Standard security check | **No fees** |

### Step 5: Account Activation
