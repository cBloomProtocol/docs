# Understanding Drops

Drops are Bloom Protocol's points system - the water drop icons you see in your navigation bar represent your accumulated rewards. Think of them as your score for participating in the ecosystem.

## What Are Drops?

Drops are points you earn for various activities on Bloom Protocol. They're displayed with a water drop icon (ðŸ’§) in the navigation menu once you're logged in. Your drop balance reflects your contribution and engagement with the platform.

### The Points System

Bloom Protocol uses two types of points:
- **Drops** - Your main reward points, shown in the navigation
- **Mini Points** - Additional points for specific activities

Your total drops balance is shown in real-time next to the water drop icon when you're logged in.

## How to Earn Drops

### Mission Rewards

The primary way to earn drops is by completing missions. Each mission offers specific drop rewards:

1. **Navigate to Missions**
   - Click on a mission to see its details
   - View the rewards section showing drop amounts
   - Complete all tasks to unlock the reward

2. **Claim Your Rewards**
   - Once all tasks are complete, the "Claim Rewards" button activates
   - Click to claim and drops are added to your balance instantly
   - Claimed missions show as "Claimed" status

### Types of Activities That Earn Drops

Based on the Progress tracking system, you earn drops from:

- **Task Completion** - Complete platform tasks
- **Mission Achievement** - Finish entire mission sets
- **Referral Activity** - Invite friends to join Bloom Protocol
- **Helpful Actions** - Contribute positively to the community
