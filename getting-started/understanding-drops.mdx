Drops are Bloom Protocol's points system - the water drop icons you see in your navigation bar represent your accumulated rewards. Think of them as your score for participating in the ecosystem.

## What Are Drops?

Drops are points you earn for various activities on Bloom Protocol. They're displayed with a water drop icon in the navigation menu once you're logged in. Your drop balance reflects your contribution and engagement with the platform.

Your total drops balance is shown in real-time next to the water drop icon when you're logged in.

## How to Earn Drops

### Mission Rewards

The primary way to earn drops is by completing missions. Each mission offers specific drop rewards:

1. **Navigate to Missions**
   - Go to your Dashboard page
   - Find missions in the Hub section
   - Click on a mission to see its details and rewards

2. **Complete Tasks**
   - Follow the requirements for each task
   - Some tasks are marked complete instantly upon submission
   - Other tasks require evaluation - they'll only be marked complete after review and meeting quality benchmarks

3. **Claim Your Rewards**
   - Once ALL tasks are verified and complete, the "Claim Rewards" button activates
   - Click to claim and drops are added to your balance instantly
   - Claimed missions show as "Claimed" status

### Types of Activities That Earn Drops

You earn drops through:

- **Mission Completion** - Only when ALL tasks in a mission are completed and verified will you receive the full mission rewards
- **Participation Bonus** - Even if you don't complete all tasks, the platform may provide participation bonuses for your efforts
- **Referral Activity** - Invite friends to join Bloom Protocol and earn when they register

<Note>
Individual task completion doesn't directly earn drops. Rewards are primarily given for completing entire missions. However, your participation efforts are recognized through bonus systems.
</Note>

We're constantly designing new ways to earn drops based on helpful actions and positive community contributions! Explore the platform regularly and discover additional opportunities as they become available. The most active and engaged users who contribute quality interactions often find rewarding activities before they're widely announced.

## Viewing Your Drops Balance

Once logged in, your drops balance appears in the top navigation:
