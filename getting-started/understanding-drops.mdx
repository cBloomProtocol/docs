## The Drops Economy

### What Makes Drops Valuable

> **Current Value:**
> - Platform recognition and status
> - Proof of early participation
> - Community credibility score
> 
> **Future Utility:**
> - Potential value realization opportunities
> - Exclusive feature unlocks
> - Community rewards distribution

## Earning Matrix

### Primary Earning Methods

| Method | Effort Level | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Mission Completion** | Variable | Daily opportunities |
| **Participation Bonus** | Low | Select missions |
| **Referral Rewards** | Medium | Per successful invite |
| **Special Events** | Variable | Weekly/Monthly |


<Note>
**The All-or-Nothing Rule**: Missions require 100% task completion. 9 out of 10 tasks = 0 drops. It's binary — complete everything or receive nothing.
</Note>

## Balance Tracking

### Where to Find Your Drops

| Location | Display Type | Details Shown |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Navigation Bar** | Counter display | Total balance |
| **Dashboard Hub** | Activity card | Full transaction history |

## Understanding Earning Patterns

### Daily Earning Potential

```
Typical Day:
Morning:   Complete 2 quick missions  = 150 drops
Afternoon: Finish 1 deep mission     = 300 drops
Evening:   Refer 1 active friend     = 50 drops
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Daily Total:                         500 drops
```

### Weekly Progression

| Day | Activity Focus | Expected Drops | Cumulative |
|-----|---------------|---------------|------------|
| **Monday** | New missions launch | 200-300 | 300 |
| **Tuesday** | Complete backlogs | 150-200 | 500 |
| **Wednesday** | Referral push | 100-150 | 650 |
| **Thursday** | Deep missions | 300-400 | 1,050 |
| **Friday** | Quick tasks | 100-150 | 1,200 |
| **Weekend** | Special events | 300-500 | 1,700 |

## Mission Completion Strategy

### The Verification Process

> **Task Status Flow:**
> 1. **Pending** → Task submitted, awaiting check
> 2. **Verifying** → System reviewing submission
> 3. **Verified** → Task approved, counts toward completion
> 4. **Failed** → Needs retry (reason provided)

### Claiming Your Rewards

| Stage | What You See | Action Required | Time Frame |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Tasks Complete** | Progress shows 100% | Wait for verification | 0-24 hours |
| **All Verified** | "Claim Rewards" active | Click to claim | Manual action |
| **Claiming** | Loading animation | Wait | Processing |
| **Success** | Balance updated | None | Complete |

### Issue Resolution Guide

| **Drops missing** | Display lag | Refresh page | Not yet |

| **Balance frozen** | System update | Wait 30 minutes | If persists |

## Drops Philosophy

### Why Not Instant Task Rewards?

The system rewards **commitment**, not activity. By requiring full mission completion:

- Quality over quantity is incentivized
- Bot farming becomes impractical
- Genuine engagement gets rewarded
- Community stays authentic

### The Long Game

> **Stack drops now. Here's why:**
> - Early adopters historically win
> - Future utility remains unlimited
> - Scarcity may increase over time
> - Community status grows with balance
