description: "Where trending meets opportunity"
---

Fresh from ProductHunt. Validated by the market. Ready for your support. Discover is your window into what's trending right now — and your chance to back it early with USDC.

<Warning>
**Real Money, Real Risk**: Discover projects require USDC pledges. This is actual financial commitment, not missions or drops. Only pledge what you can afford to lose.
</Warning>

## The Discover Philosophy

### Why ProductHunt Integration

```
Traditional Discovery:
Random projects → No validation → Pure speculation → Hope
        ↓              ↓               ↓            ↓
   Information overload   Unvetted    High risk   Regret

Discover Approach:
ProductHunt trending → Market validation → Your evaluation → Smart pledge
        ↓                    ↓                 ↓              ↓
   Community filtered    Real traction    Your research   Informed risk
```

ProductHunt isn't perfect, but it's a signal. When thousands vote for a project, something's happening. Your job: figure out if it's worth your USDC.

## What Makes Discover Different

### Discover vs Spotlight

| Aspect | Discover (This Page) | Spotlight |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Projects** | Trending from ProductHunt | Deep partnerships |
| **Validation** | Market votes | Platform vetting |
| **Your Action** | Pledge USDC | Complete missions |
| **Risk Level** | Real financial risk | Zero financial risk |
| **Reward Type** | Potential future returns | Guaranteed drops |
| **Time Horizon** | Long-term investment | Immediate learning |

<Note>
**The Key Difference**: Discover is about backing projects with money. Spotlight is about understanding projects through missions. One asks for capital, the other for time.
</Note>

## How Discover Works

### The Daily Flow

```
ProductHunt API → Fresh projects daily → Auto-populate Discover
        ↓               ↓                      ↓
   Trending now    Real-time updates     Always fresh
        ↓               ↓                      ↓
You browse → You evaluate → You decide to pledge (or not)
```

### What You're Seeing

Each project card shows:
- **Project Name & Logo**: Direct from ProductHunt
- **Tagline**: Their one-line pitch
- **Vote Count**: Market validation metric
- **Website Link**: Do your own research
- **Pledge Button**: Your entry point

> **Remember**: These aren't our recommendations. They're the market's current interests. The validation comes from the crowd, not from us.

## The Pledge System

### How Pledging Works

```
See project → Click "Pledge" → Choose amount → Confirm with wallet
      ↓            ↓              ↓                ↓
   Interest    Expand card    USDC amount    Real transaction
      ↓            ↓              ↓                ↓
Research → Still interested? → Risk assessment → Execute
```

### Pledge Options

| Amount | Type | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| **10 USDC** | Toe in water | Testing multiple projects |
| **50 USDC** | Standard support | Balanced risk/reward |
| **100 USDC** | Strong belief | High conviction plays |
| **Custom** | Your choice | Specific strategies |

### What Happens to Your USDC

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Immediate">
**Right now:**
- USDC leaves your wallet
- Goes to project address
- Transaction recorded on-chain
- You get confirmation

**No take-backs**: Once sent, it's gone.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Future Possibilities">
**Maybe later:**
- Token airdrops (if they launch)
- Product access (if they build)
- Community benefits (if they grow)
- Returns (if they succeed)

**Maybe never**: Project could fail completely.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Worst Case">
**Reality check:**
- Project disappears
- No communication
- No product launch
- Your USDC is gone

**This happens**. Be prepared.

## Evaluating Projects

### The Quick Assessment

| Signal | What to Look For | Red Flags |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **ProductHunt Votes** | Organic growth pattern | Sudden spike (botted?) |
| **Comments** | Genuine engagement | Generic praise |
| **Maker Responses** | Active, detailed | Silent or vague |
| **Website** | Professional, clear | Template, broken links |
| **Team** | Visible, experienced | Anonymous, first-timers |

### Deep Dive Research

```
Before You Pledge:
Visit website → Check team LinkedIn → Read documentation
       ↓              ↓                    ↓
   Product real?  Experience?        Clear vision?
       ↓              ↓                    ↓
Search Twitter → Join Discord → Google the founders
       ↓              ↓                    ↓
  Active community?  Engaged?     Clean history?
```

### The DYOR Framework

> **Do Your Own Research means:**
> - Never pledge based on votes alone
> - Check multiple sources
> - Verify team claims
> - Understand the product
> - Assess market need
> - Calculate risk/reward

<Warning>
**No Safety Net**: Unlike Spotlight missions, there's no vetting here. ProductHunt votes aren't due diligence. The research burden is 100% on you.
</Warning>

## Risk Management

### The Smart Approach

| Strategy | How It Works | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Small Tests** | Start with 10 USDC | Learn without burning |
| **Diversification** | Spread across projects | No single point of failure |
| **Research Time** | Hours before pledging | Knowledge reduces risk |
| **Exit Planning** | Know what you want | Clear success metrics |
| **Loss Acceptance** | Only risk disposable income | Sleep well at night |

### Common Mistakes

```
Rookie Errors:
FOMO pledge → No research → All-in on one → Surprise at loss
      ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓
  Emotional    Blind risk   No diversity   Predictable
      ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓
"It's trending!" → "Must be good" → "YOLO" → "I'm ruined"
```

### The Professional Approach

> **Think like an angel investor:**
> 1. Expect most to fail
> 2. Look for 10x potential
> 3. Diversify ruthlessly
> 4. Research thoroughly
> 5. Accept losses gracefully

## Making Your Decision

### The Pledge Checklist

Before clicking pledge, ask yourself:

```
Decision Tree:
Can I afford to lose this? → No → Don't pledge
            ↓
           Yes
            ↓
Have I researched thoroughly? → No → More research
            ↓
           Yes
            ↓
Do I understand the risks? → No → Learn more
            ↓
           Yes
            ↓
Am I emotionally prepared for loss? → No → Wait
            ↓
           Yes
            ↓
         PLEDGE
```

### The Bottom Line

> **Discover is venture capitalism for everyone.**
> 
> You're not buying products. You're not earning drops. You're backing projects with real money in hopes of future returns. Most will fail. A few might succeed spectacularly. That's the game.

**Final Thought**: Discover democratizes early-stage investment, but democracy includes the freedom to fail. ProductHunt provides signals, not guarantees. Your USDC, your research, your decision, your consequences. Invest accordingly.
