description: "How we keep it real in the age of AI"
---

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: AI-generated content. Everyone's using it, some are abusing it, and we're here making sure your genuine efforts don't get buried under a mountain of GPT-written reviews.

<Warning>
**The Truth About Our System**: We use AI to detect AI. We track patterns. We know the difference between getting grammar help and submitting ChatGPT's homework. This document explains how we maintain authenticity in an automated world.
</Warning>

## The Philosophy: Genuine Engagement Wins

### Why We Care So Much

```
The Problem:
Fake reviews → Misleading information → Bad decisions → Failed projects
     ↓              ↓                      ↓              ↓
No trust      Ecosystem damage      User losses    Platform death
```

We're building something real here. Every review, every piece of feedback — it all contributes to helping projects improve and supporters make informed decisions. When that gets polluted with AI slop, everyone loses.

## How Our Review System Actually Works

### The AI Detection Layer

> **Here's what we're doing (without revealing all our secrets):**
> - Running content through multiple AI detection models
> - Analyzing writing patterns and consistency
> - Checking for telltale AI signatures
> - Comparing against known AI responses

But here's the thing — **we don't just rely on AI detection**. That's just one factor.

### The Scoring System

| Factor | Weight | What We're Measuring |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **AI Detection Score** | High | How likely the content is AI-generated |
| **Account Status Score** | High | Your overall platform behavior |
| **Content Quality** | Medium | Actual value of the review |
| **Historical Pattern** | Medium | Your track record |

<Note>
**Using AI for grammar help?** That's fine. We can tell the difference between Grammarly fixes and ChatGPT essays. One polishes your thoughts, the other replaces them.
</Note>

## The Fingerprinting System

### What We Track (And Why)

Every time you log in, we collect a "fingerprint" — not to invade your privacy, but to understand patterns.

```
Fingerprint Components:
├── Device patterns
├── Browser configurations  
├── Network characteristics
├── Behavior patterns
└── Interaction timings
```

### The Reality Check

**We get it** — people want drops. They'll try multiple accounts, different devices, creative workarounds. We understand the hustle.

But here's our position:

> **We can't stop everything, but we can spot patterns.**
> 
> Your fingerprint tells a story. Multiple accounts from the same device? Similar behavior patterns across "different" users? We see it. We score it. We factor it in.

### Your Account Status Score

| Behavior Pattern | Impact on Score | Why |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Single account, consistent use** | Positive ++ | This is the way |
| **Genuine task completion** | Positive + | Real engagement matters |
| **AI-assisted grammar only** | Neutral | Totally acceptable |
| **Multiple suspicious accounts** | Negative -- | Pattern detected |
| **Copy-paste AI content** | Negative --- | Instant red flag |

## How Reviews Are Actually Evaluated

### The Multi-Factor Authentication

```
Evaluation Process:
1. AI Detection Check → Initial screening
2. Account Status Review → Pattern analysis
3. Content Quality Assessment → Value check
4. Human Spot Checks → Random verification
5. Final Score Calculation → Combined factors
```

### What Determines Your Result

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Approved Reviews">

**Your review passes when:**
- Original thoughts and genuine experience
- Clean account status (no sketchy patterns)
- Actual value for other users
- Proper grammar (AI-assisted or not)

**Score breakdown:**
```
AI Detection: Clean ✓
Account Status: Good ✓
Content Quality: Valuable ✓
= APPROVED + DROPS EARNED
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Rejected Reviews">

**Your review fails when:**
- Obvious AI generation detected
- Multiple account abuse patterns
- Zero actual insight provided
- Copy-paste from other sources

**Score breakdown:**
```
AI Detection: Flagged ✗
Account Status: Suspicious ✗
Content Quality: Generic ✗
= REJECTED + NO DROPS
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Ultimate Strategy (Spoiler: It's Simple)

### The Only Path That Works Long-Term

> **One Account. Real Thoughts. Genuine Engagement.**
> 
> That's it. That's the strategy.

### Why Gaming the System Fails

| Strategy | Short-term | Long-term | Why It Fails |
|----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Multiple accounts** | Maybe works | Always caught | Fingerprint patterns emerge |
| **AI content spam** | Rarely works | Never works | Detection improves daily |
| **Copy-paste reviews** | Never works | Banned | Instant detection |
| **Genuine engagement** | Always works | Compounds | The only sustainable path |

## Writing Reviews That Pass (And Matter)

### The Framework for Success

```
Review Structure That Works:
1. Your actual experience with the project
2. Specific observations (not generic praise)
3. Constructive feedback (helpful, not harsh)
4. Personal perspective (your unique view)
```

### Quality Indicators We Love

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Specificity Beats Generics">
**Bad**: "This project is innovative and has great potential."

**Good**: "The dashboard's real-time sync surprised me — updating across devices in under 2 seconds. Haven't seen this in other DeFi platforms."

We can tell you actually used the product.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Balanced Perspective">
**Bad**: "Everything is perfect!" or "This sucks!"

**Good**: "The swap feature works smoothly, but the gas estimation was off by 30%. Would help to see a breakdown of fees before confirming."

Real users notice both good and bad.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Constructive Feedback">
**Bad**: "The UI is confusing."

**Good**: "First-time users might miss the settings menu — it's hidden behind the profile icon. A tooltip on first visit would help."

This actually helps projects improve.
</Accordion>

## Common Misconceptions

### What People Think vs Reality

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| **"I can outsmart the AI detection"** | It evolves faster than your tactics |
| **"Multiple accounts = more drops"** | Multiple accounts = banned eventually |
| **"AI reviews save time"** | Rejected reviews waste everyone's time |
| **"Grammar help = cheating"** | Grammar help is perfectly fine |

### The Grammar Help Exception

<Info>
**We ENCOURAGE grammar assistance**. If English isn't your first language, or you just want cleaner writing — use those tools. We can tell the difference between:
- Grammarly fixing your spelling
- ChatGPT writing your entire review

One helps you communicate better. The other replaces your voice entirely.
</Info>

## The Transparency Promise

### What We Tell You

```
We Share:
✓ General detection methods exist
✓ Multiple factors affect scoring
✓ Genuine engagement always wins
✓ Grammar help is acceptable
```

### What We Don't Share

```
We Don't Reveal:
✗ Exact detection algorithms
✗ Specific fingerprint methods
✗ Score thresholds
✗ Pattern detection details
```

**Why?** Because the moment we reveal the exact formula, it becomes a target for gaming.

## FAQs About the Review System

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Can I use Grammarly or similar tools?">
Absolutely. We encourage clear communication. Grammar tools that polish your existing thoughts are perfectly fine. We can tell the difference between grammar correction and content generation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if English isn't my first language?">
Use whatever tools help you communicate clearly. We're looking for genuine insights, not perfect prose. A real review with grammar help beats a fake review with perfect English every time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How quickly are reviews evaluated?">
Most reviews are evaluated within 1-24 hours. Complex reviews or those requiring additional verification may take longer. Your other factors (account status, patterns) can speed up or slow down this process.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I edit a rejected review and resubmit?">
If your review was rejected for quality issues (not AI generation or account abuse), you can revise and resubmit. But if it was AI-generated, don't bother — write something genuine instead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I'm falsely flagged?">
It happens rarely, but if you believe your genuine review was incorrectly rejected, contact support through Discord. Include your review content and explain your perspective. Real content can be verified.
</Accordion>
