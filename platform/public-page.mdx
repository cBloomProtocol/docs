You don't need to understand x402 protocol to use it — we've done the heavy lifting for you.
Just share your link, get paid. That's it.

## What You Get

When you join Bloom Protocol, you automatically get a public page:

```
bloomprotocol.ai/{your-user-id}
```

Think of it like your personal "tip jar" — anyone can send you crypto directly to your wallet. No complicated setup, no protocol knowledge required.

## How to Set It Up

1. Go to [Settings](https://bloomprotocol.ai/profile/x402)
2. Add your wallet address (we support BSC and Solana)
3. That's it — your page is live

<Tip>
If you logged in with a Solana wallet, your address is already saved. Just add a EVM address if you want to receive payments on that network too.
</Tip>

## Supported Networks

| Network | Token |
|---------|-------|
| BSC | USDT |
| Solana | USDC |

<Info>
More wallets and networks coming soon.

## Customize Your Profile

Make your page look more personal:
- Add a display name
- Write a short bio
- Connect your X account (shows your avatar and handle)

All of this can be done in [Settings](https://preview.bloomprotocol.ai/profile).

## Coming Soon

We're building more ways for you to monetize your skills and time. For example:

- "100 USDT — Buy my Telegram handle"
- "500 USDT — Commission an in-depth Twitter thread"
- ...or whatever you want to offer

Your page, your rules. Stay tuned!
