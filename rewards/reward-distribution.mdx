# Reward Distribution

Bloom Protocol uses an automated reward distribution system that ensures fair, transparent, and immediate rewards for user activities. Here's how the system works:

## Distribution Mechanism

### Automatic Processing
- **Real-Time Distribution**: Rewards are distributed immediately upon task completion
- **No Manual Claims**: All rewards are automatically added to your account
- **Instant Updates**: Dashboard balance updates in real-time
- **Zero Delays**: No waiting periods or batch processing delays

### Verification and Distribution Flow
1. **Task Completion**: User completes a mission task or referral action
2. **Verification Process**: System verifies completion (automated or manual)
3. **Reward Calculation**: System calculates appropriate reward amount
4. **Instant Distribution**: Drops are immediately added to user account
5. **Balance Update**: User sees updated balance in navigation bar and dashboard

## Reward Calculation System

### Referral Rewards

#### Registration Rewards

### Tier Calculation Examples
```
Base Referral Reward: 50 drops
Supporter Tier: 50 × 1.0 = 50 drops
Advocate Tier: 50 × 1.25 = 62.5 drops
