Security isn't optional in Web3. Your wallet is your identity, your ownership, your everything. Lose it and there's no customer service hotline, no password reset, no second chances. Let's make sure that never happens.

<Danger>
**The Golden Rule**: Bloom Protocol staff will NEVER ask for your seed phrase, private keys, or passwords. Anyone requesting this information is a scammer. No exceptions.
</Danger>

## The Basics You Can't Ignore

### Your Security Checklist

```
âœ“ URL verified (bloomprotocol.ai only)
âœ“ Wallet from official source
âœ“ Seed phrase written down offline
âœ“ Two-factor enabled (email users)
âœ“ No suspicious browser extensions
```

Miss one? You're vulnerable. Get them all? You're ahead of 90% of users.

## Wallet Security Deep Dive

### The Non-Negotiables

> **Never means never:**
> - Never share your seed phrase
> - Never type it on any website
> - Never store it digitally
> - Never photograph it
> - Never email it to yourself

These aren't suggestions. They're survival rules in the decentralized world.

### Security Threat Matrix

| Threat Level | What It Looks Like | Your Defense |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **ðŸ”´ Critical** | "Enter seed phrase to verify" | Close immediately. Report. Run. |
| **ðŸŸ  High** | Unexpected transaction requests | Reject. Verify source. |
| **ðŸŸ¡ Medium** | Links in Discord DMs | Never click. Verify publicly. |
| **ðŸŸ¢ Low** | Public WiFi usage | Use VPN or wait for secure network. |

### Hardware Wallet Strategy

Serious about security? Here's the progression:

| Your Holdings | Recommended Setup | Why |
|---------------|------------------|-----|
| **Exploring** | Browser wallet | Convenience for learning |
| **Active User** | Mobile wallet + backup | Balance of security and access |
| **Significant Value** | Hardware wallet | Cold storage protection |
| **Whale Status** | Multi-sig setup | Institutional-grade security |

## Email/Google Login Security

Not using a wallet? Your email becomes your fortress.

### Lock It Down

<Info>
**Email security = Account security**. Your email provider becomes your single point of failure. Treat it accordingly.
</Info>

| Security Layer | Implementation | Priority |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| **Strong Password** | 20+ characters, unique | Essential |
| **2FA** | Authenticator app (not SMS) | Critical |
| **Recovery Backup** | Alternative email/phone | Important |

## Threat Detection Guide

### Phishing Red Flags

Know the signs before you're a victim:

| Red Flag | Example | Your Action |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Wrong URL** | bloom-protocol.ai | Check spelling carefully |
| **Urgency** | "Verify in 24 hours or lose account" | Scam. We never threaten. |
| **Too good** | "You won 10,000 drops!" | If you didn't earn it, it's fake |
| **Grammar errors** | "Congratulation! You're winner!" | Official = professional |

### Fake Wallet Apps

> **Before installing ANY wallet:**
> 1. Check official website for links
> 2. Verify publisher in app store
> 3. Read recent reviews (look for scam warnings)
> 4. Compare download numbers
> 5. Never trust Discord/Telegram recommendations

## Recovery Planning

### Before Disaster Strikes

Set yourself up for success:

```
Backup Essentials:
â–¡ Seed phrase in 2+ physical locations
â–¡ Different secure locations (not all at home)
â–¡ Metal backup for fire/water protection
â–¡ Trusted person knows location (not content)
â–¡ Recovery process tested
```

### The Authentication Truth

| Login Method | Account Recovery | Important Note |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Wallet** | Impossible without seed | Your responsibility entirely |
| **Email** | Via email provider | Depends on email security |
| **Different wallet** | Creates new account | Cannot merge or transfer |

<Note>
**Remember**: Switching authentication methods = new account. The system sees different wallets as different people. Choose your method and stick with it.
</Note>

## Emergency Procedures

### Suspected Compromise

**STOP. BREATHE. ACT FAST.**

```
1. Disconnect from platform immediately
2. Check wallet for unauthorized transactions
3. Move funds if possible (wallet compromise)
4. Change email password (email compromise)
5. Document everything
6. Report to support with evidence
```

### Lost Access Scenarios

| Situation | Can We Help? | Your Options |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Forgot wallet password** | No | Check wallet provider's options |
| **Lost seed phrase** | No | If wallet's locked, it's gone |
| **Email account hacked** | Maybe | Work with email provider first |
| **Changed phones** | Yes | Re-install wallet with seed phrase |

## Staying Ahead of Threats

### Your Daily Habits

Make these automatic:

**Quick checks:**
- URL before connecting
- Transaction details before signing
- Wallet permissions monthly
- Login activity weekly

**Red lines:**
- Seed phrase requests = scam
- Unexpected tokens = suspicious
- Rush tactics = manipulation
- Too good to be true = it is

### Information Sources

| Channel | Trust Level | Use For |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Official Website** | âœ… Verified | Announcements |
| **Official Twitter** | âœ… Verified | Updates |
| **Discord Announcements** | âœ… Verified | Community news |
| **Discord DMs** | â›” Never | Nothing. Ever. |
| **Telegram Messages** | â›” Never | Scammers paradise |

## The Security Mindset

### Think Like a Target

Because you are one. Every wallet is a target. Every user is a potential victim. The question isn't if someone will try to scam you â€” it's when.

**Your defense**: Paranoia with a smile. Verify everything. Trust cautiously. When in doubt, don't.

### Community Protection

See something suspicious? Say something. Your report might save someone else.

```
Report suspicious activity:
â†’ Discord: #report-issue
â†’ Include screenshots
â†’ Don't engage with scammers
â†’ Warn others publicly
```
