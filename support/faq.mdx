</Tip>

## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What exactly is Bloom Protocol?">
Think of it as the bridge between ambitious builders and early believers. Projects showcase their vision before they're famous. Supporters complete missions, earn drops, and back the future unicorns. Everyone wins when projects succeed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I jump in?">
```
1. Visit bloomprotocol.ai
2. Connect your wallet (Phantom, OKX, etc.)
3. Complete a mission
4. Start earning drops
```

That's it. You're now part of the ecosystem.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need crypto to start?">
**For browsing and missions**: No crypto needed. Connect a wallet, complete missions, earn drops.

**For pledging to projects**: Yes, you'll need USDC.

Your wallet is your identity, but your bank account can stay closed until you're ready to pledge.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where's the mobile app?">
There isn't one — and you don't need one. The website works perfectly on mobile. Same features, same missions, same drops. Just open your browser and go.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Onsite Missions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do missions actually work?">
Every mission is a collection of tasks. Complete all tasks, claim your reward. It's that simple.

Here's the catch: **you must complete ALL tasks**. 9 out of 10 doesn't cut it. The system won't let you claim until everything's done.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What kind of tasks am I doing?">
Tasks fall into a few categories:

| Task Type | What You Do | Verification Time |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Social** | Follow, like, share | Instant to 5 minutes |
| **Content** | Write reviews, create posts | Up to 24 hours |
| **Engagement** | Explore projects, try features | Usually instant |
| **Feedback** | Answer surveys, give opinions | Varies |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why did my task fail?">
> **The usual suspects:**
> - Your social profile is private
> - The URL you submitted is broken
> - Your content didn't meet quality standards
> - You submitted the same thing twice

Fix it and try again. Most tasks let you retry.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I repeat missions?">
No. One shot per mission. But new missions drop regularly, so there's always something fresh to complete.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Quick Fixes to Try First" defaultOpen={true}>
Before you panic, try these:

**Refresh the page** — Yes, really. It fixes more than you'd think.

**Clear your cache** — Old data causes weird problems. Clear browser cache and cookies.

**Try a different browser** — Chrome acting up? Try Firefox. Or vice versa.

**Check your wallet connection** — Disconnected wallets cause mysterious failures. Reconnect and try again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mission and Task Problems">
**Tasks not completing?** 
Some tasks need evaluation. Wait at least 30 minutes before assuming something's broken. Evaluation tasks can take up to 24 hours.

**Rewards not showing?** 
Refresh the page first. If drops are still missing after 5 minutes, check your Recent Activity card. Still nothing? Time to [report it](/support/report-issue).

**Can't claim rewards?** 
Verify ALL tasks are actually complete. The system won't let you claim with incomplete tasks. Check each task's status carefully — the system doesn't lie about this.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Drops

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What are drops anyway?">
Drops are your score. That water drop icon in your navigation? That's your balance. Complete missions, refer friends, participate — drops accumulate. They're proof of your contribution to the ecosystem.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much can I earn?">
It varies by mission complexity:

| Mission Type | Typical Reward |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Quick social tasks** | 50-100 drops |
| **Content creation** | 100-500 drops |
| **Deep engagement** | 500+ drops |

The harder the mission, the bigger the reward.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the point of drops?">
Right now: Recognition and status.

Coming soon: 
- Platform governance rights
- Priority access to investments
- Exclusive features
- Community privileges

Stack them now, benefit later.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Referral Program

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do referrals work?">
Share your code. Friends join. You both earn.

Your unique code lives in your dashboard. Every person who joins through your link and completes missions adds to your drops. More referrals = higher multiplier on future earnings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the referral tiers?">
| Your Referrals | Your Status | Reward Multiplier |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0-9 | Supporter | 1x |
| 10-24 | Advocate | 1.25x |
| 25-49 | Ambassador | 1.5x |
| 50+ | Champion | 2x |

Higher tier = more drops for everything you do.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When do I get referral rewards?">
Instantly when your referral:
- Completes registration
- Finishes their first mission
- Hits activity milestones

No waiting, no pending, just instant drops.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Supporting Projects

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What's pledging?">
Pledging = backing projects with USDC before they blow up. You're not buying tokens or equity. You're showing support and getting in early.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I pledge?">
Navigate to a project you believe in:

1. Click **"Pledge"**
2. Choose amount (10, 50, 100 USDC or custom)
3. Approve in your wallet
4. Done — you're an early supporter
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do I get for pledging?">
**Immediately**: Proof you backed them early.

**Potentially**: 
- Airdrops if they launch a token
- Early access to products
- Supporter-only communities
- Whatever the project decides to reward early believers with
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get refunds?">
Depends on the project. Each sets their own terms. Read before you pledge. Some offer refunds, some don't. Know what you're getting into.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Issues

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Wallet won't connect?">
The checklist:
- Wallet unlocked? Check.
- Right network? Check.
- Browser extensions interfering? Disable them.
- Cache cleared? Do it.
- Different browser? Try it.

Still stuck? [Report it](/support/report-issue).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Completed task but no drops?">
**Wait** — Some tasks need verification (up to 24 hours).

**Check** — Did you actually complete ALL requirements?

**Refresh** — Sometimes the UI needs a nudge.

**Report** — If it's been over 24 hours, something's wrong.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Site running slow?">
> Your end: Check internet, clear cache, disable extensions.
> 
> Our end: Sometimes we're updating. Check Discord for announcements.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Account Security

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I stay safe?">
**The golden rules:**
- Never share your seed phrase. Ever. With anyone.
- Only connect on bloomprotocol.ai
- Verify URLs before connecting
- If it feels sketchy, it probably is
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have multiple accounts?">
No. One person, one account. Multiple accounts = ban. Don't risk it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Lost my wallet access?">
Your wallet IS your account. Lose the wallet, lose the account. No recovery possible. This is Web3 — with great power comes great responsibility.

**Back up your wallet properly. Now.**
</Accordion>
