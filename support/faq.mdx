## Getting Started

### What is Bloom Protocol?
Bloom Protocol is a platform that democratizes early-stage startup support by connecting supporters with promising projects before they raise major funding. Users can complete missions to earn drops (points) and pledge support to featured projects.

### How do I get started?
1. Visit bloomprotocol.ai
2. Connect your Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. Complete your first mission to earn drops
4. Explore the Discover page to find projects to support
5. Join the community to connect with other supporters

### Do I need cryptocurrency to use the platform?
You'll need a Web3 wallet to connect to the platform and USDC to make pledges to projects. However, you can browse projects and complete many missions without any cryptocurrency.

### Is there a mobile app?
Bloom Protocol is fully optimized for mobile browsers. Simply visit the website on your mobile device for a full-featured experience.

## Missions and Tasks

### How do missions work?
Missions are collections of tasks that earn you drops when completed. Each mission contains multiple tasks organized by categories (like "Social Media" or "Community Engagement"). Complete all tasks in a mission to earn maximum rewards.

### What types of tasks are available?
- **Social Media Tasks**: Following, liking, sharing, commenting
- **Content Creation**: Writing reviews, creating posts, making videos
- **Engagement Tasks**: Platform interaction and community participation
- **Survey Tasks**: Providing feedback and answering questions

### How long does task verification take?
- **Automated Tasks**: 1-5 minutes for social media engagement
- **Manual Review**: 1-24 hours for content creation tasks
- **Failed Tasks**: Can usually be retried with corrections

### Why did my task fail verification?
Common reasons include:
- Broken or incorrect URLs
- Private social media profiles
- Low-quality or off-topic content
- Duplicate submissions
- Not following task requirements

### Can I complete the same mission multiple times?
No, each mission can only be completed once per user. However, new missions are regularly added to the platform.

## Rewards and Points

### What are drops?
Drops are Bloom Protocol's primary reward currency, displayed as a water drop icon in your navigation bar. You earn drops by completing missions, referring users, and participating in the community.

### How are drops calculated?
- **Mission Tasks**: 10-200 drops per task based on complexity
- **Referrals**: 50-150 drops per successful referral (tier dependent)
- **Quality Bonuses**: Additional drops for high-quality submissions
- **Completion Bonuses**: Extra drops for completing entire missions

### What can I do with drops?
Currently, drops serve as community recognition and may provide future benefits including:
- Platform governance voting rights
- Priority access to investment opportunities
- Exclusive features and services
- Special community privileges

### Are there different types of points?
Yes, there are two main types:
- **Drops**: Primary currency for most activities
- **Mini Points**: Special currency for specific campaigns or events

## Referral Program

### How does the referral system work?
Share your unique referral code with others. When they join using your code and become active users, you earn drops. Higher referral tiers provide increased earning multipliers.

### Where do I find my referral code?
Your referral code appears automatically in your dashboard after connecting your wallet. Look for the referral section to copy your unique code.

### How are referral tiers determined?
- **Supporter (0-9 referrals)**: 1x base rewards
- **Advocate (10-24 referrals)**: 1.25x multiplier
- **Ambassador (25-49 referrals)**: 1.5x multiplier
- **Champion (50+ referrals)**: 2x multiplier

### When do I receive referral rewards?
Referral rewards are distributed automatically when:
- Referred user completes registration and wallet connection
- Referred user completes their first mission
- Referred user reaches activity milestones

2. Click "Pledge" on a project that interests you
3. Choose your pledge amount (10, 50, 100 USDC or custom)
