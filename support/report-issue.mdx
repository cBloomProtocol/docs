Found a bug? Something broken? Can't complete a mission? We've got you covered — but there's only one way to get help that actually works.

<Tip>
**Quick Summary**: Join Discord → Go to Support group → Open ticket in #report-issue → Stay active in your private channel
</Tip>

## The Only Way That Works

### Join Discord First

> **The golden rule**: All support happens in Discord. Period.

Whether you're a supporter hunting for drops or a builder creating the future, you need to be in our Discord. That's where support happens. Not email, not Twitter DMs, not shouting into the void.

**→ Join here**: [discord.gg/JyMtzjzmJZ](https://discord.gg/JyMtzjzmJZ)

### Find the Right Channel

Once you're in Discord, navigate to the **Support** group. You'll see a channel called **#report-issue**. That's your destination. Not general chat, not random channels — specifically #report-issue.

### File Your Ticket

In #report-issue, create your ticket. The bot will guide you through it. This isn't just preferred — **it's the only way to ensure your issue gets tracked and resolved**.

<Warning>
Issues reported anywhere else might get lost. Seriously. Use #report-issue or risk being ignored.
</Warning>

## What Makes a Good Report

### The Essentials

When you file that ticket, include:

| Information | Example | Why It Helps |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **What broke** | "Can't claim rewards on Solana mission" | Specific problems get specific solutions |
| **When it happened** | "3:45 PM EST, January 20" | Helps us check server logs |
| **What you were doing** | "Clicked claim after completing all tasks" | We can recreate your exact steps |
| **Your setup** | "Chrome, Mac, Phantom wallet" | Different setups = different bugs |

### Screenshots Save Time

A picture really is worth a thousand words.

**What to capture:**
- **Error messages** — The exact text and popup
- **Stuck screens** — Where the UI freezes
- **Wrong displays** — Incorrect data or formatting
- **Console errors** — F12 → Console tab (for tech-savvy users)

Upload directly in Discord. The support team can see them immediately.

### One Issue, One Ticket

Got three problems? File three tickets. Mixing issues in one report creates confusion, delays resolution, and frustrates everyone. Keep it clean — one problem per ticket.

## What Happens After You Report

### The Flow

| Step | What Happens | Your Part |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **1. Review** | Real humans read your ticket | Wait for initial response |
| **2. Investigation** | We recreate and diagnose the issue | Answer any questions promptly |
| **3. Resolution** | Fix deployed or workaround provided | Test and confirm it's working |

### Response Times

Every issue is important to us. Our support team handles tickets with equal priority, ensuring everyone gets the attention they deserve.

**How we work:**
- Each ticket is reviewed by our dedicated support team
- We address issues as quickly as possible
- You'll receive updates throughout the resolution process

**Your private support channel**: When you open a ticket, Discord creates a private channel just for you and our support team. This dedicated space ensures:
- Direct communication with the team
- Privacy for sensitive information
- Focused discussion on your specific issue

**Pro tip for faster resolution**: Stay active in your support channel. Our team might need additional details or ask you to test solutions. Quick responses from both sides mean quicker fixes. Think of it as a collaborative effort — we're solving this together.

## Tips From Support Veterans

### What Works

> **Clear descriptions** win. "Claim button stays gray after completing all 5 tasks in Solana mission" is perfect.

> **Stay calm** even when frustrated. The team wants to help, but hostility slows everything down.

> **Follow up** if you don't hear back in expected timeframes. Polite bumps are fine.

### What Doesn't Work

> **Vague complaints** like "nothing works" help nobody.

> **Multiple channels** — reporting the same issue everywhere doesn't make it faster.

> **Demands and threats** — really doesn't motivate anyone to help you faster.

## The Bottom Line

Problems happen. Bugs exist. Things break. But we can only fix what we know about, and we can only know about it if you tell us properly.

### The Support Path

```
Discord → Support group → #report-issue → File ticket
```

That's the path. That's the way. Everything else is just noise.

<Note>
Remember: The support team is human. They're working to help you. A little patience and clarity goes a long way toward getting your issue resolved quickly.

## Security Issues Are Different
<Danger>
Found a vulnerability? Something that could compromise user accounts or funds?

**STOP. Do NOT post it publicly in #report-issue.**

Security vulnerabilities require special handling:

1. **Find a moderator or admin** in Discord (they have special roles/badges)
2. **Send a PRIVATE direct message** — never in public channels
3. **Start your message with "SECURITY ISSUE"** for immediate attention
4. **Include details privately** — what you found, how to reproduce, potential impact

We take security seriously. Responsible disclosure protects everyone. You're helping the entire community by reporting privately.

**Never discuss security vulnerabilities in public channels. Ever.**
